## Best Paper Award Criteria
This version of the document has been proposed and discussed by the Visualization Steering Committee. 
For changes to the process please send a formal request to the steering committee (vsc@ieee.org).

### Paper Award Types
From 2021, as a unified conference, IEEE VIS will have two tiers of awards for full papers as follows:
* **Best paper award:** papers with a best paper award represent the top 1% of papers submitted to IEEE VIS in a given year
* **Honorable mention award:** papers with an honorable mention award are in the top 5% of papers submitted to IEEE VIS in a given year

### Candidate Selection
**During Review:**
For each assigned paper, each program committee member gives a 5-point rating to indicate to which degree the paper deserves a paper award. 
They also write a best paper award recommendation in case of a high rating. In addition, the reviewers assigned to a paper discuss whether the paper deserves an award. 
The discussion is documented by the primaries on their review form.

**After Review:**
Area paper chairs create a short list of up to the ceiling of 5% of all papers from their area to avoid potential issues with discretization. 
For example, an area with 50 submissions should nominate 3 papers maximum (the ceiling of 0.05*50 papers). These papers should be selected from the clear accept category. 

The overall paper chairs are responsible for selecting the final short list such that the final list contains a maximum of 5% of all papers submitted to the conference. 
The overall paper chairs choose which papers to exclude in case the sum of all suggestions from the area paper chairs exceeds 5% of all submitted papers. 
Paper pdfs and review metadata for papers on the short list will be handed to a best paper committee that selects the best papers from the list. 
All papers not chosen from the final shortlist made by the overall paper chairs will become honorable mention papers. 

### Best Paper Award Committee
After the candidate list has been established, the overall paper chairs propose a best paper committee. 
Members of the committee cannot have a paper in the top 5% list. 
The committee has at least 5 members and is approved by the Visualization Executive Committee (VEC). 
The committee should be broad enough in expertise to represent the IEEE VIS areas and should as much as possible represent a mix of academic lineage and demographics. 
Committee members should have a record of serving on the IEEE VIS PC or related conferences. 
It is recommended that the committee includes at least one past paper chair, past award winner, and past best paper committee member. 

### Best Paper Committee Decision Making Process
The committee receives the shortlisted papers with paper metadata including: anonymized reviews, best paper nomination scores, summary of changes, revised paper, and 
best paper discussion text. The main task of the committee is to select the best papers from the shortlist. The remaining papers from the shortlist will receive an honorable 
mention award. The overall number of best paper awards cannot exceed 1% of all papers submitted to the conference.

The committee is free to choose their own decision making mechanisms. The IEEE Visualization Steering Committee recommends to 
(1) narrow down choices for best papers by nomination scores and review scores as well as the summarized best paper nomination discussions; then 
(2) complete a more in-depth review of the remaining materials to choose the final set of best papers. 
We do not expect the committee to re-review papers but in cases where the above information does not lead to a clear decision, 
the submissions can be read to make their own judgement.
