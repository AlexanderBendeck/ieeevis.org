IEEE VIS welcomes applications from candidates who would like to act as General Chairs in hosting future conferences.

Those who are interested should use the [IEEE VIS General Chair Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AaIJ62xvdRFLhhh7IY_HIleNS9TEjGDuutx12PDWgS4/edit?ts=602bda3a) to contact the VIS Executive Committee ([VEC](mailto:vec@ieeevis.org)) with their ideas, credentials and possible host cities.

We are looking to hold IEEE VIS in well-connected cities around the world that could provide the facilities and backdrop for an excellent conference.

## Process

IEEE VIS conferences are established through a two-stage process:

#### STAGE 1. INITIAL APPLICATION: General Chairs and General Location

Potential General Chairs **express their interest** in hosting the conference by submitting a short [VIS General Chair Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AaIJ62xvdRFLhhh7IY_HIleNS9TEjGDuutx12PDWgS4/edit?ts=602bda3a) for consideration by the VEC.

The form asks for:
 1. names and credentials in terms of the applicantsâ€™ contributions to visualization and their planning and delivery of previous projects to tight budgets and timelines
 2. when you might be able to host VIS - which years
 3. initial ideas about the region or city in which VIS may be held
 4. any local support that might be provided

The VEC will consider these applications and will provisionally approve attractive and strong applications. The approved ones will be moved forward to Stage 2 (described below, _Detailed Bid_) - establishing a time and specific location for the conference. Depending on the current schedule of planned future conferences, this may occur:
 * _immediately_, for a near future conference, or
 * _subsequently_ for a later conference

#### STAGE 2. DETAILED BID: Specific Location and Venue from Provisionally Approved Chairs

Provisionally approved General Chairs will be introduced to IEEE contacts and will then work with the IEEE and the conference Finance Chairs to identify and secure suitable venues for the conference, accommodation and associated activities, to develop a detailed bid to **deliver the IEEE VIS conference** on a particular date.

IEEE will provide support in assessing venues, negotiating prices, finding accommodation and contracts, etc. in developing this full bid. The level and specifics of support provided by the IEEE will depend on the general location, but discussions with IEEE representatives are essential at this stage.
The intention will be to develop a full bid that involves a host city, specific venue, costings, and options for timing. The VEC will consider such bids and establish a series of future conferences accordingly.

**Currently, we are accepting expressions of interest for 2023 and onwards.**

## Expectations

* The role of General Chairs (GCs) may be fulfilled by an individual or a small team (maximum of three), who work together closely with well-defined roles.
* The conference will be run in close association with the VIS Steering Committee (VSC) and VEC in accordance with the roles and responsibilities described in the [IEEE VIS Charter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CzoEKf0CiHvybLsB44OcoD9OFiCTT210/view?usp=sharing).
* The bid can be for a different city than where the GCs live or work, to open up the chair-ship to people who live in places that are not amenable for hosting large conferences.
* Dates should be in the mid-October to early-November time frame.
* The VEC would like some flexibility in terms of the year in which the conference will occur, to be able to vary geographic locations year by year.
* If you have any questions about this process or want to discuss your ideas, please contact the VEC at [vec@ieeevis.org](mailto:vec@ieeevis.org).
 * Note suggested timings and locations are indicative at this stage and venues are not considered. Decisions on timings and venue are determined in close collaboration with the IEEE who contact venues and establish a detailed proposal depending upon costs and availability once potential General Chairs and indicative timings and locations have been approved.
