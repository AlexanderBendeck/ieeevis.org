Immersive Analytics is a new multidisciplinary initiative to explore future
visualization and interaction technologies for data analytics. Immersive
Analytics aims to bring together researchers in Information Visualization,
Visual Analytics, Virtual and Augmented Reality and Natural User Interfaces.
This workshop looks at immersive technologies (e.g., AR, VR, Mixed reality,
NUIs, large displays), scenarios, theories and frameworks, collaboration,
physical and tangible visualization, as well as interaction techniques.

You've heard of Game Jams and Hack-a-thons--DiscoveryJam brings this same
intense, hands-on approach to scientific discovery. Our full day workshop
brings scientists together with VIS participants in an interactive day-long
workshop to create innovative approaches to scientific discovery problems.
Each DiscoveryJam scientist is matched with a small group of attendees. In
the morning each group holds interactive discussions with their scientist
about specific data and science problems. In the afternoon, each group hacks
away on the scientist's data. We'll create sketches, prototypes, and sample
visualizations, and then present them to the entire workshop. You'll leave
the workshop with skills for communicating with scientists, approaches to
cross-disciplinary collaboration, and research ideas to pursue further.
Bring your laptop and your favorite vis tools to dig into data with us.

DSIA brings together researchers at the intersection of databases,
machine learning, and interactive visualization. These three areas
have important things to say to each other. Modern data visualization
depends on the cutting edge of both database and machine learning
research: database researchers are exploring techniques for storing
and querying massive amounts of data; machine learning techniques
provide ways to discover unexpected patterns and to automate and scale
well-defined analysis procedures. This workshop explores the idea that
the next generation of database, machine learning, and interactive
visualization systems should not be designed in isolation. For
example, machine learning techniques might recommend improved data
transformation and visual encoding decisions. Or, database query
optimizers might take advantage of perceptual constraints, while
prefetching methods reduce latency by modeling likely
interactions. This workshop seeks to increase cross-pollination
between these fields.

We make thousands of subconscious decisions daily and often apply simplified
rules or heuristics to speed up the process. Most of these are good enough,
however when there is some uncertainty we can make what appears to be
irrational decisions, leading to inaccurate judgements, also known as
cognitive biases. Over the last 40 years, hundreds of cognitive biases have
been documented, such as the confirmation bias, where people unconsciously
seek out information that confirms their current belief, ignoring information
to the contrary. Despite a growing awareness of the detrimental effects of
cognitive biases on decision making, there is little work on how to detect
this behaviour in those who use visualisation-based applications and even
less on how to minimise their effect. The aim of this workshop is to bring
together people from a wide range of disciplines such as information
visualisation, visual analytics, software engineering, cognitive psychology
and decision science, as well as those close to end-user groups like
intelligence analysts and medical practitioners, to explore some of the ways
in which cognitive biases impact user performance and share ideas about
practical ways to reduce or overcome these potentially harmful effects,
especially in adapting the tools developers design and build.

The pedagogy of data visualization is becoming increasingly important as data
visualization techniques and tools proliferate.  In this workshop, we propose
to create a community of practice that provides a structured medium to learn
from data visualization teaching strategies from each other.  The focus is on
sharing innovations in the classroom when teaching data visualization.  The
half-day interactive workshop will include lightning talks/demonstrations
followed by breakout sessions focused on topics related to teaching large
classes, teaching at a liberal arts college, teaching a professional masters'
course, and so on.

The first Workshop on Visualization for the Digital Humanities at VIS 2016
created a new platform to discuss challenges in the emerging digital
humanities field. The 2nd workshop this year aims (1) to single out new
research directions in visualization for the digital humanities, (2) to
familiarize the visualization research community with the problems faced by
digital humanities researchers, and (3) to establish future collaborations
between visualization and digital humanities scholars.


## <a name="interpretable-dl"></a> [VADL 2017: Workshop on Visual Analytics for Deep Learning](https://vadl2017.github.io)

VADL 2017, the workshop on visual analytics for deep learning, is a half-day
workshop held in conjunction with the IEEE VIS 2017 Conference.  The primary
goal of the workshop is to bridge the gap by bringing together researchers
from both the machine learning and visual analytics fields, which allows us
to push the boundary of deep learning. The workshop should provide an
opportunity to discuss and explore ways to harmonize the power of automated
techniques and exploratory nature of interactive visualization.

In the US and in most countries abroad, women account for a relatively small
fraction of those earning degrees in computer science. Those from some ethnic
backgrounds are also greatly underrepresented. While no specific figures are
currently available to describe the diversity of the visualization community,
a glance around a typical room during VIS seems to suggest that
demographics are similar. Research studies have documented that diverse teams
and companies produce better outcomes (more robust designs, more productivity,
more profit). This lack of diversity in our community limits our potential.
This half-day workshop seeks to address that lack by encouraging
undergraduates from underrepresented groups and their allies to consider
graduate study and careers in visualization. The workshop includes an
overview of the diversity and climate of the visualization community, panels
by near peers and senior researchers, and interaction opportunities.
Participants should leave the workshop with increased knowledge about
opportunities in visualization, a greater understanding of challenges and
strategies, and a wider network of those sharing their goals.

The 2017 ViP Workshop on Visualization Solutions in the Wild is an opportunity
for visualization practitioners and researchers to meet and share experiences,
insights, and ideas in applying the latest visualization and visual analytics
research to real world problems. It targets work at the interface between
visualization research and specific application domains. It is highly
interdisciplinary and focused on delivering actual value to users. This year,
we specifically focus on *visualization solutions in the wild*, i.e. on tools,
systems, or frameworks which are actively used. The workshop will cover all
aspects from their initial conception and design, the process of getting them
into use, and the long-term work of extending and sustaining them.
