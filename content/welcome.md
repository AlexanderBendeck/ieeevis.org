G'day!

IEEE VIS is headed to Australia in 2023—the first time VIS is being held in the Southern Hemisphere. 

The face-to-face conference will be held at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, on the banks of the Birrarung (Yarra River), in the heart of the City of Melbourne. We acknowledge Traditional Owners of Narrm, the Boon Wurrung and Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people of the Kulin nation, on whose land VIS 2023 will be held. We pay our respects to their Elders past, present and emerging.

VIS 2023 will be the year's premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics. The conference will convene an international community of researchers and practitioners from universities, government, and industry to exchange recent findings on the design and use of visualization tools.

We invite you to share your research, insights, and enthusiasm at IEEE VIS. As usual, the 2023 program will also feature a diverse range of symposia and co-located events.

We’re looking forward to seeing you in Melbourne.
