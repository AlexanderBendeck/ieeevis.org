We recognize that we are living in uncertain and unprecedented times. To respond to the COVID-19 situation and its effects on our global community, VIS 2022 will be a hybrid conference. We have implemented the following measures for on-site attendees:  
* All attendees are required to mask when indoors using a well-fitting (at least surgical) mask. We recommend high-quality (e.g., KN-95, N95, FFP2, or better) masks.
* Vaccination is expected for all in-person attendees. Please Note: Vaccination documentation may be required for travel. Please visit the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html#anchor_1634924936642">United States Center for Disease Control website</a> for additional details. 
* All attendees are strongly encouraged to test regularly, including prior to arriving at the conference.
* If you experience any symptoms or test positive for COVID before or during the conference, please do not attend in person. 

**If you have symptoms or tested positive for COVID during the conference time**:
