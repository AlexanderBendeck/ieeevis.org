As a new component to the IEEE VIS 2022 program, we are holding AMA ("Ask Me Anything") sessions on 5:15-6:00pm immediately following the technical program components on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  These session will feature dynamic speakers from the VIS community in a casual setting to engage the VIS community.  Each of the VIS22 General Chairs will act as moderators for these sessions.

Speakers will field questions about how they came to visualization research, professional development, their viewpoints on the field as a whole, and work/life balance.

These informal "fireside" chats will take place as primarily as an in-person format and will not be recorded or live streamed.  Virtual participants will be able to ask questions ahead of time via slido.
