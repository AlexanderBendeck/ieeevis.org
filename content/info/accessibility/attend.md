IEEE VIS seeks to cultivate an environment that encourages participation and inclusion. Our goal is to make IEEV VIS 2022 as accessible as possible. The following is information about the accessibility of various components of VIS 2022. Please contact us at accessibility@ieeevis.org, if you have questions, concerns or would like to provide feedback.
 
## How do I communicate accessibility needs to organizers?
During registration, you can indicate that you have accessibility needs. We will follow up with you to discuss your needs in more detail. If you find that any of the online platforms do not support your needs, you can contact accessibility@ieeevis.org, and we will work with you to ensure you can participate on the platforms.  
 
## Are the conference technologies accessible?
We have made efforts to ensure that the pre-recorded video presentations and streamed sessions include captioning. 
 
Some of the events are on Gather.town. Gather.town has documented accessibility issues, including but not limited to: 
- Limited support for closed captioning
- Limited support for sign language interpreters
- No support for screen readers
- Limited support for people with low vision and low dexterity.
 
We recognize that the use of Gather.town places barriers for individuals to participate in the conference fully and we will have student volunteers (SVs) available to support engagement on this platform. SVs can help participants navigate the spaces to find participants or rooms using the follow feature. Please email accessibility@ieeevis.org to request SV support for a block of time or as needed.  There is also a help desk in Gather.town, if you find yourself having trouble while on the platform. SVs will be available at the Gather.town help desk throughout the conference. 
 
## Will captions be available?
Yes, all live events in the main sessions will be captioned by professional stenographers. The recorded talks are also captioned. Workshops and supplementary live events will not be captioned. 
 
## Will presenters be visible?
We encouraged presenters to be visible in the recorded talks but this was not required. Presenters in live sessions will be visible. 
 
## Whom should I contact if I have a problem with accessibility during the event?
Please contact accessibility@ieeevis.org, and we will try to resolve your issue.
