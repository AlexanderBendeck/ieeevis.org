<p><b>Speakers</b> <br/>Dr. Drew Berry, WEHI Australia, and Anders Ynnerman, Linköping University Sweden</p>

<p><b>Title</b> <br/>Visualizing the Chemistry of Life  on giant 360-degree screens
</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b> <br/>
Our keynote presentation will take you on a journey through the creative storytelling and technical challenges of bringing multi-scale visualizations to giant-sized fulldome screens. Our immersive 360-degree film, 'Chemistry of Life', launched in 2023, presents an ultra-high resolution stereo 8K experience that explores the life around us from what we experience every day to the hidden microscopic realms of the molecular. The production takes you on a journey into your inner universe, combining advanced scientific visualizations to bring you into the dynamic, molecular world we all carry within us. We explore the powerhouses of cells, mitochondria, and learn how chemical processes connect us to all other life forms on Earth. Throughout this presentation, we will discuss the technical and artistic challenges we faced, as well as the scientific research that informed our approach. Our hope is that this film will inspire a deeper appreciation for the world around us and encourage us all to continue exploring and learning about the mysteries of our universe.
