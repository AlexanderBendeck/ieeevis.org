<p><b>Speaker</b> <br/>Dr. Marti Hearst, UC Berkeley</p>

<p><b>Title</b> <br/>Show It or Tell It? Text, Visualization, and their Combination </p>

<p><b>Abstract</b> <br/>
In this talk I will share observations about the role of language in visualization and in other modes of visual expression.  I will pose questions such as: how do we decide what to express via language vs via visuals?   How do we choose what kind of text to use when
creating visualizations, and does that choice matter?  Does anyone prefer text over visuals, under what circumstances, and why?  Why is visualization ineffective for expressing text content?  And most speculatively, what does the increasing prevalence of visual
communication mean for the future of text?
