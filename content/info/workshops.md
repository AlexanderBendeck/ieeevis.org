BELIV 2022 is the international forum to broadly discuss research methods in visualization. Our discussions span from novel and not-yet fully established evaluation methods for visualization tools and techniques, to methods that more generally establish the validity and scope of acquired visualization knowledge. BELIV supports contributions and discussions from the rich spectrum of visualization researchers, embracing the varied ways that researchers self-identify with respect to the main conference tracks at VIS.

The VIS4DH workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from the fields of visualization and the humanities to discuss new research directions at the intersection of visualization and (digital) humanities research.

The role of visualization in artificial intelligence (AI) gained significant attention in recent years. With the growing complexity of AI models, the critical need for understanding their inner-workings has increased. Visualization is potentially a powerful technique to fill such a critical need.

The goal of this workshop is to initiate a call for "explainables" / "explorables" that explain how AI techniques work using visualization. We believe the VIS community can leverage their expertise in creating visual narratives to bring new insight into the often obfuscated complexity of AI systems.

Communicating climate science to the general public is necessary to enhance salience, understanding, and engagement and to accelerate action. Visualizations of climate data offer an integral way of communicating climate change findings to diverse audiences; however it is challenging due to the multi-dimensionality of data, the complexity of science, the diversity of users, their biases, and needs across different stakeholder groups. While graphics support thinking and enhance storytelling, creating data visualizations of climate data that can overcome comprehension difficulties, avoid misconceptions, preserve scientific integrity, and instill trust remains a challenge. This half-day workshop aims to establish a community of practice around data-driven visual climate science communication and in so doing address one of the grand challenges in our era. The workshop seeks to define what ‘high impact’ means in the domain of climate science communication, and to unpack the techniques, methods, and challenges for achieving it. The mission is to pull expertise from within IEEE Vis, bridge the gap between research and practice, and others who typically do not attend the conference, share lessons learned, identify directions for research, foster collaborations, and understand where and what we should do better as a community of practice.
