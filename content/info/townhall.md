As part of IEEE VIS's ongoing efforts to engage with our community, the IEEE VIS governance bodies are seeking feedback from the VIS community! 
Join us from *8AM* to *9AM* Wednesday October 25th at Room 101-102, and via [streaming](https://monash.zoom.us/j/87692005110?pwd=UVowZzdTK2pLaE5kMmE2bW9kMUNrQT09). Webinar ID: 876 9200 5110. Webinar passcode: 039956.

Learn more about what the IEEE VIS governing bodies took on as priorities for VIS 2023 and come suggest priorities for the IEEE VIS governing bodies to address as we move towards VIS 2024. All members of the VIS community are welcome!
