As part of IEEE VIS's ongoing efforts to engage with our community, the IEEE VIS governance bodies are seeking feedback from the VIS community! 
Join us *Wednesday Oct. 19th* from *12:00 - 1:30PM CDT* at Room Oklahoma Station 4, and via streaming. Learn more about what the IEEE VIS governing bodies took on as priorities for VIS 2022, and come suggest priorities for the IEEE VIS governing bodies to address as we move towards VIS 2023. All members of the VIS community are welcome!
Questions from the community are welcome during the townhall either onsite or via Slido.
