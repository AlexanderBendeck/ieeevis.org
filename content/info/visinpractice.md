The **VisInPractice** associated event at **[IEEE VIS 2022](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/welcome)** will feature four panels on the practice of visualization.

The **VisInPractice** program is an opportunity for visualization practitioners and researchers to meet and share experiences, insights, and ideas in applying data visualization and visual analytics to real use cases. Our goal is to acknowledge successful transfers of visualization research into applications as well as current visualization practices in industry.

This year's Vis in Practice will be a hybrid event, with panel sessions being simultaneously in person and streamed.
