Requests for letters containing additional information, such as date of birth or passport information (number, date of issue, expiration date, place of issue), may be e-mailed to: <a href="mailto:visa-letters@ieeevis.org"> visa-letters@ieeevis.org</a>.  <b>You must be fully registered for the conference before any letter can be issued.</b>

### Registration FAQS

**Q: I am a poster author. Do I need to register using the Author Registration category?**
<ul>
No. Posters are non-archival materials, and Author Registration is not needed. Poster presenters and authors should use the regular On-Site Participant Registration category. 
</ul>

**Q: My workshop/symposium/associated event paper will not be published in IEEE Xplore. Do I need to register using the Author Registration category?**
<ul>
No. Workshop or symposium papers not published in IEEE Xplore are non-archival materials, and Author Registration is unnecessary. Paper presenters and authors should use the regular On-Site Participant or Virtual Participant Registration categories. 
</ul>

**Q: If I complete an Author Registration, do I also need to separately complete an On-Site or Virtual Participant Registration to attend the conference?**
<ul>
No. Author registration includes the benefits of an on-site or virtual participation, and thus completing it will enable attendance in your preferred mode.
</ul>
