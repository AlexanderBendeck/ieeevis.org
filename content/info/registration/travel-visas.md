## Visa Application General Information

If you are planning to attend VIS 2023 and may need a visa, we encourage you to read the following information provided by the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection. 

We recommend that all overseas participants read this carefully. Under Australia’s universal visa system, all visitors to Australia must have a valid visa to travel to and enter Australia (the only exceptions to this are New Zealand passport holders and permanent residents of Norfolk Island). 

There are many visa options available to people wishing to visit Australia. The appropriate visa option will depend, amongst other things, on the person’s purpose for visiting Australia, and the passport they are holding. The [visa finder web page](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-finder) can be of help to find out which visa is suitable for you.

Please also refer to the [Business Information Sheet](https://ijcai-17.org/BusinessInformationSheet.pdf) for guidance on the visa options that may be most suitable for you. 

Please also refer to the [General Information for Visa Applicants](https://ijcai-17.org/GeneralInformation.pdf). 

Please take into account processing times and lodge visa applications as early as possible as it can take 6-8 weeks for the approval process. The following passport holders are able to access [Australia’s Electronic Travel Authority (ETA)](https://www.eta.homeaffairs.gov.au/ETAS3/etas) issuing system online. An ETA provides authorisation to travel to and enter Australia and is electronically linked to your passport. To apply for an ETA online, you must hold a passport from one of the following countries or regions: 

* Brunei Darussalam 
* Canada 
* Hong Kong (SAR PRC) 
* Japan 
* Malaysia 
* Singapore 
* Korea, Rep of (STH) 
* United States

If you are not eligible to apply for an ETA online you might be able to apply through a travel agent, airline or at an [Australian visa office](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/contact/offices-locations). As part of the application/approval process, you will be issued with a Reference Number. You will need the Reference Number to check the status of your ETA or your application. 


**Strong** __NB: These are the visa options available presently but the Department of Immigration and Border Protection reserves the right to change regulations. Assistance will NOT guarantee a visa grant. Visa applicants must demonstrate that they meet all the legislative requirements for an Australian visa.__
