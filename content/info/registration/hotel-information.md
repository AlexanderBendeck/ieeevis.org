All in-person conference events for VIS 2022 will be held in the Omni Oklahoma City Hotel. Omni Oklahoma City Hotel is located across the street from the 
<a href="https://www.visitokc.com/bricktown">Bricktown District</a>, a favorite destination for visitors and locals alike. The hotel is about 10 miles 
from the <a href="https://flyokc.com/"> Will Rogers World Airport </a> in downtown Oklahoma City.

# Conference Hotel

The conference rate is <b>$189 per night </b> (not including taxes). The cutoff date for reservations under this rate is 
<b>September 16, 2022</b>.  After this date, we cannot guarantee availability of the hotel rooms for the specified rate.

Staying in the conference hotel has a lot of advantages not only for the participants. Having occupied many rooms improves renting conditions
of the conference facilities and is therefore good for the whole conference. In particular, it may allow better onsite food and beverage 
covering. Because of this, we ask you to book the hotel only via the link below.
