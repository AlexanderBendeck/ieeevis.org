# BEWARE OF SCAMMERS
Due to the amount of publicly available information on conference and institution websites, some committee members and conference speakers are being contacted by third party companies, often from overseas, purporting to be event managers who request to secure accommodation or flight bookings. These requests always ask for financial information or credit card details and will generally be quite pushy in their attempts. Firms claiming to be legitimate accommodation and travel agents for your event, such as Business Travel Management and are not endorsed or authorised by the conference organisers. They are actively trolling event webs and trying to match invited speakers and committees with personal details often found on their own institute websites.

Please note, ASN Events will never ask a third party to retrieve credit card or financial information from you without prior personal arrangement with yourself and an ASN staff member. Where any payments are required, ASN Events will send through an invoice with remittance details which contains full ASN Letterhead, completed by an ASN Staff member and will always be from an @asnevents.net.au email address.
If for any reason you are unsure of the legitimacy of a requested payment, you should always contact your ASN Events Project Manager, Joy Sanchuj.
We take the protection of the information you provide to us very seriously, including your contact details and any financial information and have instituted secure IT platforms to protect your data.
