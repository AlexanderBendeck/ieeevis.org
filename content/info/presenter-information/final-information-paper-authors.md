This page provides authors of accepted IEEE VIS Full Papers with important information for the remainder of the process until the conference.  

IEEE Vis Short Papers will follow a similar set of guidelines, with a couple of exceptions: (a) the camera ready deadline is one week earlier (August 1), (b) the paper length limits are shortened to 4+1 pages, and (c) talk length limits are shortened.

## Camera-Ready Paper Submission

**DEADLINE: August 8.** Submit final camera ready papers and supplemental materials via the PCS submission system.  Files submitted here are the default versions that we will for preparing proceedings in IEEE Xplore and the downloadable content.

Camera-ready papers may not exceed 11 pages (9 pages of main text and 2 pages of references). The [VGTC website](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/journal) has complete information regarding formatting requirements of your final revised PDF. We do not need hardcopy.

Please check the second round reviewer comments (if any) and incorporate their suggestions. Note: there will not be further detailed proof-reading of your submission, so PLEASE read through your manuscript very carefully to fix any remaining grammar and spelling problems. If you are not a native English speaker, we very strongly recommend you recruit one to do the final careful pass on your paper. Also note the strict page limits. The 10th and 11th pages, if used, may not contain anything other than references (we will be strict on this). Finally, your paper should not be anonymized in the final version. The paper must include authors and affiliations. Note that if you have been anonymizing then you may find you have to trim your text to fit into the page limits once authors and affiliations are added.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure the final submission data in PCS is identical to the final PDF (e.g., title, author names and last names, affiliations, author order, email addresses.) You might need to correct the information in your PCS login in order to update the author information. You can do this by logging into your PCS account > my account > Change my contact information. Note that the author list has to be **identical** to the list that you provided for the abstract submission deadline (March 21).

You can submit supplemental material (e.g. a video, appendix) for your work for inclusion in the digital archive. TVCG requires that supplemental material is also peer-reviewed, hence, this is only allowed if you have already submitted your supplemental material and if the reviewers have found it acceptable. Videos are usually up to 5 minutes in length, and you may also include other supplemental material such as additional images, appendices, or source code. 

Please see our [Open Practices page](/year/2022/info/open-practices/open-practices) for requirements and recommendations for open practice for VIS 2022.

Please see our [VIS Accessibility Guide](/year/2023/info/call-participation/make-pdf-accessible) for requirements for VIS 2023 authors on how to make your contribution accessible for broader audiences.


## Other Required Submission Items

Shortly after receiving final notifications from the second review cycle, the conference will send you an email from the Publications chairs with complete instructions.  This email will be sent to the corresponding author for the paper and it will include a unique submission ID.  The email will also include links to directly upload files via Dropbox.  Here is what you will be expected to submit and the deadlines for each item.

### 1. Author registration

Regardless of if you are attending in person or virtually, one author for each paper [must register](/year/2022/info/registration/conference-registration) at the speaker rate.  This does not need to be the author who is presenting the paper.

### 2. Video Preview Submission

**DEADLINE: August 15.** It is **mandatory** for authors to submit a [25-sec Video Preview](/year/2022/info/presenter-information/fast-forward-and-video-previews). Video previews should be submitted through a DropBox link that will be distributed via email soon.

### 3. Author Information Form

**Deadline: September 8.**  You will be asked to complete a brief google form that specifies: (a) Who will be presenting the paper, (b) if the presenter is planning to attend in person or virtually, (c) if you have posted your paper to a preprint server (and where), (d) if this publication is subject to Plan S, and (e) practitioner information.  Please use the same submission ID as was provided in the email we sent to you.   

### 4. Paper Presentation Video Recording

**DEADLINE: September 8.** It is **mandatory** for authors of all VIS papers to submit a [recording of their paper presentation](/year/2022/info/presenter-information/talk-recording-guide). 

For presenters who are attending virtually, these presentations should comply with the talk length requirements, as they will be played during the session.  Please leave room for live Q+A.  For presenters who are attending in person, this talk recording need not follow the exact specifications of the VIS format for length, e.g. it could provide extended information beyond what you will present in person.  We will not play this video during the conference, but it will be hosted on our virtual website.

Videos are required for all presenters (virtual and in-person) to enable a consistent online experience (no missing videos from on-site presenters, redundancy in case of unforeseen circumstances) and as high-quality archival material. For on-site participants, we also see this as an opportunity to produce high-quality video content that could go beyond the scope of a live talk. 

### 5. Representative Image

**DEADLINE: September 8.** As described in the [talk recording guide](/year/2022/info/presenter-information/talk-recording-guide), it is also **mandatory** for authors to submit a representative image with caption for use on the virtual website.


### 6. Copyright Release

**DEADLINE: September 8.** For papers that will be published in IEEE TVCG or on IEEE Xplore, authors are asked to complete a copyright release form.  This will be handled via IEEE's Conference Publishing Services (IEEE CPS) via a link provided to you via email.



## Common Editing Mistakes and Notes from TVCG

Please make all efforts to submit your camera ready paper to PCS by August 8th.

Common editing issues: 
* Use the correct JOURNAL style template [https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/journal](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/journal).
* Index terms are mandatory.
* The abstract and index term sections use an em-dash between the heading and content; there should not be a space on either side of the em-dash and the content begins on the same line as the heading.
* Acknowledgment section—is it complete and correct?
* Titles: Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word).
* Inclusion of the "manuscript received" block on the bottom of page 1 exactly as is. The 'xx’ placeholders should remain. They will be populated at a later date by TVCG. 
* Do NOT include page numbers.
* Figure captions begin with “Fig. #” and go below the figure.
* Table captions begin with “Table #.” and go above the table.
* Figures should not be formatted vertically along a page and authors should not be stacking double column figures on top of single column figures, and vice versa. 
* Text should not be wrapping around any figures, either.

Authors, please pay attention to the whole template, not just the list above.

We are looking forward to an exciting and vibrant IEEE VIS 2022!
