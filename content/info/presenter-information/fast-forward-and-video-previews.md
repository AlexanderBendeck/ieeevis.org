Please **read the following instructions carefully** and submit your
25-second video for the online Video Previews by the following deadlines:
- VIS Full/Short Papers: Aug. 15
- All Associated Events and TVCG/CG&amp;A Presentations: Sept. 1


Video previews and fast forwards are a great opportunity to publicize
your work or event to a wide audience. Video previews are accessible
from the conference website on the VIS Vimeo channel prior to, during,
and after the conference. 




Like last year, due to IEEE VIS going fully virtual, video previews are linked 
from the conference's webpage and will be compiled into 'trailers', one for
each session. **There will be no Fast-Forward session this year.** 




<!--
At least one author for each accepted
submission is required to present a 25-second preview of their work
during a Fast Forward (FF) session held at the conference. The same
25-second video supports both purposes: it will be archivally
available as a standalone video with audio track, and it will also be
played during the FF session **without** the audio track while the
author speaks. Voiceover narration in the audio track is strongly
recommended to make the archival video most useful, but is not
mandatory.

## Video Previews: 


- A video preview should be self-explaining and self-contained. 
- It should clearly communicate your research and contribution and invite readers to read your paper.
- Other than in recent years' Fast-Forwards sessions, we discourage humor and trailer-like 'ads'. 
- The video will exist for a long time and can be shared widely by the authors on social media and other channels. 
- The video should contain audio narration. We discourage salient music to focus viewersâ€™ attention on the content.
- Subtitles are mandatory to increase accessibility. See below for tips on how to create and include subtitles


## Do I need to submit a Video-Preview? 
If your track is not listed, please check for updates later as all track chairs are finalizing their decisions.

## How to record your video?
Please see the [Talk Recording Guide](/year/2021/info/presenter-information/talk-recording-guide) on how to format your Video Preview.

 
## How to submit?
- Video previews need to be submitted through the IEEE CPS system. The submission links for individual tracks will be updated shortly.
- Please submit your video file and caption/subtitle file separately and do not bake the subtitles into the video. We will do the integration in a consistent way.


Please **make sure that your video adheres to these specifications otherwise it will not be accepted** and will have to be revised.

**Video Creation:**
There exists a wide range of software to create videos. Here is a list of widely used software to get you started:
- Camtasia: https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html
- OpenShot: https://www.openshot.org 
- Adobe Premiere:  https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/premiere.html	
- iMovie: https://www.apple.com/imovie/ -->

<!-- 
**Automated Subtitles / Captions:**
We ask that you submit a .srt file along with your video. One way to create such a file is to use the automatic YouTube captioning functionality as explained here:  https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554. Generating captions automatically can take some time. Make sure that you manually correct the generated subtitles for errors by directly editing the .srt file in a text editor. If captions cannot be generated manually, you can use the YouTube Studio interface to add captions manually, too.


**Video Encoding:** 
- To encode/re-encode your video in the right format, we recommend to use the free software Handbrake: https://handbrake.fr/ 
- To check that your video is in the right format, we recommend to use the free software MediaInfo: https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo
