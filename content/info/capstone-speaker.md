<p><b>Title</b> <br/>
  Visualizing Inequality: What We Can Learn From Grassroots Data Activism
</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b> <br/>
In the face of social inequality, journalists and advocates are increasingly compiling their own datasets, analyzing them, and visualizing them to work towards social transformation. This talk presents an in-depth case study from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262048873/counting-feminicide/" target="new_window"><i>Counting Feminicide: Data Feminism in Action</i></a> (MIT Press, 2024), a book about transnational data activism that is challenging the gender-related killings of women and girls. Grassroots activists document and visualize violence in ways that center care, memory, healing, and justice. This talk puts forth the argument that there are lessons to draw from their work for how to sensitively represent violence and inequality through data, most notably through employing alternative epistemological frameworks, embodied visual grammars, and strategic political calculations.
