The land on which this conference takes place was the traditional home of the 
"Hasinais" Caddo Nation and "Kirikir îi:s" Wichita & Affiliated Tribes. We
acknowledge that this territory once also served as a hunting ground, trade
exchange point, and migration route for the Apache, Comanche, Kiowa, and Osage
nations. Today, 39 tribal nations dwell in the state of Oklahoma due to settler
and colonial policies designed to assimilate Native people. IEEE VIS recognizes
the historical connection this conference site has with indigenous communities.
We acknowledge, honor and respect the diverse Indigenous peoples connected to
this land. We fully recognize, support, and advocate for the sovereign rights of
all of Oklahoma's 39 tribal nations. This acknowledgment is aligned with the
University of Oklahoma and IEEE VIS's core value of creating a diverse and
inclusive community. It is an institutional responsibility to recognize and
acknowledge the people, culture, and history that make up our entire community
and host city.
