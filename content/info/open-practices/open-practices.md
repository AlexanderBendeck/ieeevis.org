Visualization research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. As a community, there are several steps we can take to help ensure that research presented at VIS is (1) reproducible, (2) replicable, and (3) extensible by future researchers. As such, the Open Practices Committee for IEEE VIS 2022 is providing a set of **requirements** and **recommendations** for authors of accepted VIS papers. Note that the recommendations are only suggestions which authors can optionally follow to increase the long-term impact and usefulness of their work.

This page covers:
* [**Requirement** 1/1—Ensure you are compliant with Plan S](#requirement-11ensure-you-are-compliant-with-plan-s)
* [**Recommendation** 1/2—Upload a preprint to a free and open repository](#recommendation-12upload-a-preprint-to-a-free-and-open-repository)
* [**Recommendation** 2/2—Upload supplemental material to a free, open, and long-term archive](#recommendation-22upload-supplemental-material-to-a-free-open-and-long-term-archive)
* [Questions, comments, concerns?](#questions-comments-concerns)

## **Requirement** 1/1—Ensure you are compliant with Plan S

**Camera-ready checklist:**

1. Tell us on the camera-ready submission form whether you believe that your paper is covered under Plan S and the associated funding or research institution. We will follow up with you individually with options and next steps to ensure your publication can appear in VIS.

**More details:**

Plan S is an Open Access initiative that was started in 2018. [Specific funding and research institutions](https://www.coalition-s.org/organisations/) require work funded by them be published in open repositories or in journals that provide free access to manuscripts. In part, authors covered by Plan S must make their accepted manuscript available for free and published under an Open License (such as CC-BY).

The policy at IEEE for accommodating authors whose papers are covered under Plan S is currently evolving. At present, IEEE works with authors' constraints on a case-by-case basis.

*IEEE VIS is committed to helping any author affected by Plan S find an accommodation so that their work can appear at VIS and on IEEE Xplore.*

Please see our blog post on [Publishing papers covered under Plan S](../../blog/plublishing-under-plan-s) for details.

## **Recommendation** 1/2—Upload a preprint to a free and open repository

**Camera-ready checklist:**

1. Post a preprint version of your paper to a free and open access repository (e.g. arXiv) before the camera-ready deadline. We have [several tutorials you can follow](open-practices-arxiv).

2. On the Author Submission Portal provided by IEEE in the final stages of publication, enter either:
   * the URL that points to the preprint version of your article in the open access repository

   OR
   * a reason why you cannot share the paper on an approved open access repository.

**More details:**

VIS authors have the right to post the final preprint version of their accepted article to an open access repository before the print deadline. We recommend that authors exercise this right, as the audience of your work is improved if you post the final version of your accepted paper to a reliable open access repository. Research hidden behind a paywall is inaccessible to many readers.

Please review the [Open Access Preprint Guide and FAQ](open-practices-faq), in which we provide:

* [Criteria for which repositories are findable, accessible, identifiable, and reliable.](open-practices-faq#open-access-repository-criteria)
* [Instructions for sharing the preprint with VIS using the Author Submission Portal.](open-practices-faq#sharing-the-preprint-with-vis-in-the-author-submission-portal)
* [A discussion of IEEE's preprint policy](open-practices-faq#is-sharing-the-preprint-compatible-with-ieees-publication-policy) and how it affects [where you can share the paper](open-practices-faq#where-can-i-share-the-paper) and [which version you can share](open-practices-faq#which-version-of-the-paper-can-i-share).
* [Notice that you can put your paper on a personal or institutional webpage, but that it may not meet Open Access criteria](open-practices-faq#can-i-put-my-paper-on-my-personalinstitutional-webpage).
* [An explanation of why Plan S does not affect preprints](open-practices-faq#what-about-plan-s)

We also provided [several tutorials you can follow](open-practices-arxiv) on how to post preprints on arXiv.

## **Recommendation** 2/2—Upload supplemental material to a free, open, and long-term archive
