Visualization research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. As a community, there are several steps we can take to help ensure that research presented at VIS is (1) reproducible, (2) replicable, and (3) extensible by future researchers. As such, the Open Practices Committee for IEEE VIS 2022 is providing a set of **requirements** and **recommendations** for authors of accepted VIS papers. Note that **the recommendations are not requirements**, but rather guidelines that authors can follow to increase the long-term impact and usefulness of their work.

## **Requirement** 1/1—Ensure you are compliant with Plan S

Plan S is an Open Access initiative that was started in 2018. [Specific funding and research institutions](https://www.coalition-s.org/organisations/) require work funded by them be published in open repositories or in journals that provide free access to manuscripts. In part, authors covered by Plan S must make their accepted manuscript available for free and published under an Open License (such as CC-BY).

The policy at IEEE for accommodating authors whose papers are covered under Plan-S is currently evolving. At present, IEEE works with authors' constraints on a case-by-case basis.

*IEEE VIS is committed to helping any author affected by Plan-S find an accommodation so that their work can appear at VIS and on IEEE Xplore.*

Please see our blog post on [Publishing papers covered under Plan-S](../../blog/plublishing-under-plan-s) for details.

**Camera-ready checklist:**

1. Tell us on the camera-ready submission form whether you believe that your paper is covered under Plan S and the associated funding or research institution. We will follow up with you individually with options and next steps to ensure your publication can appear in VIS.

## **Recommendation** 1/2—Upload a preprint to a free and open repository

This accessibility can be improved if authors post the final version of their accepted paper to a reliable open access repository. VIS can facilitate an increase in sharing of papers by informing authors of this option, establishing guidelines for which repositories are freely accessible and reliable, helping authors use those repositories, and dispelling misconceptions.

This page informs VIS authors of their ability to post the final preprint version of their accepted article to an open access repository before the print deadline. In addition, this page provides instructions for posting to arXiv, a commonly used preprint repository that complies with IEEE copyright regulations.

## **Recommendation** 2/2—Upload supplemental material to a free, open, and long-term archive
