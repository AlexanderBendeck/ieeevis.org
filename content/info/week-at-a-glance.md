# Program week at a glance

Below is a *preliminary* schedule the conference.  Additional details for the events are available on their webpages, and more detailed information will be available soon on the virtual VIS website.

Note that room/track assignments are not final, and thus the columns in the table below do not represent the final tracks.  We currently have only released the list of the time slots (organized as rows). 

Daily sessions are four blocks per day, each 75 minutes.  There are breaks for coffee from 10:15-10:45am and 3:15-3:45pm.  A lunch break runs from 12:00-2:00pm each day.
