Best paper and honorable mention awards are selected by a dedicated committee of experienced community members. Both awards recognize outstanding work from the pool of accepted papers. Best paper committees use a variety of criteria to select the best paper including potential impact to the community, the importance of any results obtained, technical challenges overcome, etc.

## Full Papers

The Best Papers Committee for VIS 2021 full papers consists of five distinguished members: Stephen North (Chair), Tatiana Landesberger von Antburg, Stefan Bruckner, Ingrid Hotz, and G. Elisabeta Marai. The Papers Chairs Committee would like to thank the Best Papers Committee for their work and to congratulate the awardees!

### Best Papers

**Feature Curves and Surfaces of 3D Asymmetric Tensor Fields**
<br/>
Authors: Shih-Hsuan Hung, Yue Zhang, Harry Yeh, Eugene Zhang 

Justification: “This paper makes fundamental advances to the field of asymmetric tensor field visualization. It contributes a novel topological approach in conjunction with a practical algorithmic solution. Thus, this study addresses a challenging problem with outstanding, innovative solutions, and has high potential to impact future visualization applications in tensor visualization.”

**IRVINE: Using Interactive Clustering and Labeling to Analyze Correlation Patterns: A Design Study from the Manufacturing of Electrical Engines**
<br/>
Authors: Joscha Eirich, Jakob Bonart, Dominik Jäckle, Michael Sedlmair, Ute Schmid, Kai Fischbach, Tobias Schreck, Jürgen Bernard

Justification: “This paper is a model design study on applying visual analytics to a manufacturing process. It addresses a practical, emerging, and largely unexplored problem, and presents exemplary collaborative work highlighting the power of visual analytics. The proposed solution was developed in deep collaboration with domain experts over several iterations, carefully distilling tasks and effective visualizations. The paper showcases a strong evaluation, and convincingly demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed analytics and interaction modalities that clearly improve the performance of manufacturing engineering professionals in analytic tasks.”

**Perception! Immersion! Empowerment! Superpowers as Inspiration for Visualization**
<br/>
Authors: Wesley Willett, Bon Adriel Aseniero, Sheelagh Carpendale, Pierre Dragicevic, Yvonne Jansen, Lora Oehlberg, Petra Isenberg

Justification: “This paper is bold, innovative, fun, thorough and persuasive, and a wonderful and rare example of breakthrough, creative thinking about data visualization research. It introduces two theoretical frameworks to explore the dual issue of epistemic powers (i.e. that advance knowledge) in vision and cognition, and their important key mechanics, which span instruments to fairness and accessibility. It provides an original, important and legitimate perspective on what we do, including a wider perspective on evaluating the benefits of visualization. This paper will be remembered for many years for its original perspective, thought-provoking messages and persuasive explanations.”

**Simultaneous Matrix Orderings for Graph Collections**
<br/>
Authors: Nathan van Beusekom, Wouter Meulemans, Bettina Speckmann

Justification: “This paper presents a technically sound approach and novel evaluation technique for simultaneous matrix ordering of multiple graphs. This is an important problem in graph comparison and in dynamic graph visualization. The paper is outstanding in its clarity, and aims at reproducible results. The evaluation that is presented should have considerable impact on future research. This work has wide applicability both in graph drawing, and in other matrix-based visualizations.”
