Best paper and honorable mention awards are selected by a dedicated committee of experienced community members. Both awards recognize outstanding work from the pool of accepted papers. Best paper committees use a variety of criteria to select the best paper including potential impact to the community, the importance of any results obtained, technical challenges overcome, etc.

## Full Papers

The Best Papers Committee for VIS 2022 full papers consists of seven distinguished members: Tamara Munzner (chair), Remco Chang, Ingrid Hotz, Petra Isenberg, Tatiana von Landesberger, Rüdiger Westermann, and Xiaoru Yuan. The Papers Chairs Committee would like to thank the Best Papers Committee for their work and to congratulate the awardees!

### Best Papers

**Affective Learning Objectives for Communicative Visualizations**
<br/>
Authors: Elsie Lee-Robbins, Eytan Adar 

Justification: “This thoughtful and well-written paper presents an interesting and provocative perspective on visualization design, with a clear and compelling argument that all visualizations are affective whether that context is explicitly discussed or not. The paper's proposed taxonomy of affective learning objectives is informed by a methodologically sound and well-designed qualitative study. It provides guidance on how to improve the visualization community's mechanisms to surface those decisions, and help visualization designers reflect upon them.”

**Multiple Forecast Visualizations (MFVs): Trade-offs in Trust and Performance in Multiple COVID-19 Forecast Visualizations**
<br/>
Authors: Lace Padilla, Racquel Fygenson, Spencer C. Castro, Enrico Bertini

Justification: “This comprehensive yet concise paper illuminates an important visualization problem by providing empirical evidence for the link between COVID-19 forecast visualization design choices and trust: visualization design choices easily influence trust, but notably trust is not indicative of successful interpretation. The methodology is exemplary, with high ecological validity thanks to the use of real-world data, and a preregistered analysis plan for the first two studies in addition to a third study clearly labelled as exploratory. This nicely executed investigation features insightful results that include actionable design guidelines; the release of both data and analysis scripts provides a foundation for future analysis and exploration of this highly relevant topic.”

**Uncertainty-Aware Multidimensional Scaling**
<br/>
Authors: David Hägele, Tim Krake, Daniel Weiskopf

Justification: “This clear and well-motivated paper addresses the significant open question of how to incorporate uncertainty into dimensionality reduction methods. It presents both a mathematical model and a numerical algorithm, with a detailed discussion of several visual encoding techniques that are suitable for analyzing the resulting uncertain data. The results include a detailed sensitivity analysis with a synthetic dataset, and a walkthrough of several real-world datasets to demonstrate the versatility of their algorithm and the benefits of their mathematical model.”
