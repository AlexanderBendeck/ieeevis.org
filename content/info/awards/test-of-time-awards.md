## VAST
<b>2010: <br>
iVisClassifier: An interactive visual analytics system for classification based on supervised dimension reduction.<br/>
Jaegul Choo, Hanseung Lee, Jaeyeon Kihm, and Haesun Park</b><br>
DOI: [10.1109/VAST.2010.5652443](https://doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5652443)

JUSTIFICATION: Supporting data mining tasks with interactive systems is a challenging area of study and this 2010 VAST paper, co-authored by Jaegul Choo, Hanseung Lee, Jaeyeon Kihm, and Haesun Park pioneered this area, presenting iVisClassifier one of the first  interactive Visual Analytics system supporting  classification tasks based on a supervised dimension reduction method that attempt to optimize the cluster structures by grouping the data with given labels, i.e.,  Linear Discriminant  Analysis (LDA). Being, in general, the result of such an activity still high dimensional (number of clusters -1) the system dealt with the challenging task of allowing the user to explore different 2D LDA projections, getting a better understanding of the underlying computational model.

This interesting solution has influenced subsequent research and applications dealing with similar approaches, as demonstrated by the overall number and the increasing trend of citations in the last ten years.

<b>2000: <br>
Polaris: a system for query, analysis and visualization of multi-dimensional relational databases. <br>
Chris Stolte, Diane Tang and Pat Hanrahan </b><br>

Polaris: a system for query, analysis and visualization of multi-dimensional relational databases.<br>
Chris Stolte, Diane Tang, Pat Hanrahan </b><br>
DOI: [10.1109/2945.981851](https://doi.org/10.1109/2945.981851)

JUSTIFICATION: The paper presented Polaris, an interface for exploring large multidimensional databases.  Beside having a high citation count (850 when paired with the follow-up TVCG journal paper with the same title) this excellent paper became the core for a successful InfoVis product (Tableau), demonstrating that academic research can have a very broad impact outside the research community. Polaris's original work was seen as an invitation to think out of the box. It has remained highly cited in recent years, and the 67 patent citations also stand out. The journal paper was also reprinted in 2008 as an ACM Technical Highlight, which further broadened its audience.

<b>2010: <br>
Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data.<br>
Edward Segel and Jeffrey Heer</b><br>
DOI: [10.1109/TVCG.2010.179](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.179)

JUSTIFICATION:  The paper introduced the concept of narrative storytelling, which started a new theme of research at InfoVis. It has led to a substantial number of important follow-up work at Vis and elsewhere, actively discussed in blogs and visualization courses.  Narrative storytelling emerged simultaneously in journalism circles, leading to amazing stories seen by wide audiences. The theme remains vibrant today, with the 2010 Infovis paper widely credited, as demonstrated by the 900 citations reported by Google Scholar.

## SciVis

<b>1995: <br>
High Dimensional Brushing for Interactive Exploration of Multivariate Data.<br>
Allen R. Martin and Matthew O. Ward </b><br>
DOI: [10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485139](https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485139)

JUSTIFICATION:  The paper elaborates on the concept of brushing, the ability to map features in a view of a few dimensions to other dimensional viewpoints or perspectives. The technique is in widespread use today.  From the thirteen patent citations, one may infer that it has been incorporated into commercial offerings, broadening the impact of this paper.  While he may not have invented the idea of brushing, the second author, Matt Ward, is widely credited with bringing the technique to the attention of the visualization community.

<b>2005: <br>
The Value of Visualization.<br>
Jarke J. van Wijk </b><br>
DOI: [10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532781](https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532781)

<b>_followup journal paper_<br>
Views on Visualization.<br>
Jarke J. van Wijk</b><br>
DOI: [10.1109/TVCG.2006.80](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.80)

JUSTIFICATION: This paper addressed the nature and impact of the field or domain of Visualization.  This paper in either of its versions has become a staple for the field, assigned as reading for students gaining their first exposure to visualization in many academic courses.  It has remained highly cited in recent years.  If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, this paper has been followed by other papers reflecting on the importance, value, .and impact of their domains, which is another justification of its impact over time.
