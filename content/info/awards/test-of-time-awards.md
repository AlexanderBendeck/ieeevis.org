DOI: [10.1109/VAST.2010.5652443](https://doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2010.5652443)

ABSTRACT:  We present an interactive visual analytics system for classification, iVisClassifier, based on a supervised dimension reduction method, linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Given high-dimensional data and associated cluster labels, LDA gives their reduced dimensional representation, which provides a good overview about the cluster structure. Instead of a single two- or three-dimensional scatter plot, iVisClassifier fully interacts with all the reduced dimensions obtained by LDA through parallel coordinates and a scatter plot. Furthermore, it significantly improves the interactivity and interpretability of LDA. LDA enables users to understand each of the reduced dimensions and how they influence the data by reconstructing the basis vector into the original data domain. By using heat maps, iVisClassifier gives an overview about the cluster relationship in terms of pairwise distances between cluster centroids both in the original space and in the reduced dimensional space. Equipped with these functionalities, iVisClassifier supports users' classification tasks in an efficient way. Using several facial image data, we show how the above analysis is performed.

JUSTIFICATION: Supporting data mining tasks with interactive systems is a challenging area of study and this 2010 VAST paper, co-authored by Jaegul Choo, Hanseung Lee, Jaeyeon Kihm, and Haesun Park pioneered this area, presenting iVisClassifier one of the first  interactive Visual Analytics system supporting  classification tasks based on a supervised dimension reduction method that attempt to optimize the cluster structures by grouping the data with given labels, i.e.,  Linear Discriminant  Analysis (LDA). Being, in general, the result of such an activity still high dimensional (number of clusters -1) the system dealt with the challenging task of allowing the user to explore different 2D LDA projections, getting a better understanding of the underlying computational model.

This interesting solution has influenced subsequent research and applications dealing with similar approaches, as demonstrated by the overall number and the increasing trend of citations in the last ten years.

Polaris: a system for query, analysis and visualization of multi-dimensional relational databases.<br>

ABSTRACT: In the last several years, large multi-dimensional databases have become common in a variety of applications such as data warehousing and scientific computing. Analysis and exploration tasks place significant demands on the interfaces to these databases. Because of the size of the data sets, dense graphical representations are more effective for exploration than spreadsheets and charts. Furthermore, because of the exploratory nature of the analysis, it must be possible for the analysts to change visualizations rapidly as they pursue a cycle involving first hypothesis and then experimentation. The authors present Polaris, an interface for exploring large multi-dimensional databases that extends the well-known Pivot Table interface. The novel features of Polaris include an interface for constructing visual specifications of table based graphical displays and the ability to generate a precise set of relational queries from the visual specifications. The visual specifications can be rapidly and incrementally developed, giving the analyst visual feedback as they construct complex queries and visualizations.

JUSTIFICATION: The paper presented Polaris, an interface for exploring large multidimensional databases.  Beside having a high citation count (850 when paired with the follow-up TVCG journal paper with the same title) this excellent paper became the core for a successful InfoVis product (Tableau), demonstrating that academic research can have a very broad impact outside the research community. Polaris's original work was seen as an invitation to think out of the box. It has remained highly cited in recent years, and the 67 patent citations also stand out. The journal paper was also reprinted in 2008 as an ACM Technical Highlight, which further broadened its audience.

2010: Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data.<br>
Edward Segel and Jeffrey Heer<br>
DOI: [10.1109/TVCG.2010.179](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.179)

ABSTRACT: Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal stories within data, yet these “data stories” differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.

JUSTIFICATION:  The paper introduced the concept of narrative storytelling, which started a new theme of research at InfoVis. It has led to a substantial number of important follow-up work at Vis and elsewhere, actively discussed in blogs and visualization courses.  Narrative storytelling emerged simultaneously in journalism circles, leading to amazing stories seen by wide audiences. The theme remains vibrant today, with the 2010 Infovis paper widely credited, as demonstrated by the 900 citations reported by Google Scholar.

1995: High Dimensional Brushing for Interactive Exploration of Multivariate Data.<br>
Allen R. Martin and Matthew O. Ward<br>
DOI: [10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485139](https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1995.485139)

ABSTRACT: Brushing is an operation found in many data visualization systems. It is a mechanism for interactively selecting subsets of the data so that they may be highlighted, deleted, or masked. Traditionally, brushes have been defined in screen space via methods such as painting and rubberband rectangles. In this paper we describe the design of N-dimensional brushes which are defined in data space rather than screen space, and show how they have been integrated into XmdvTool, a visualization package for displaying multivariate data. Depending on the data display technique in use, brushes may be specified and manipulated via direct or indirect methods, and the specification may be demand-driven or data-driven. Various brush operations such as highlighting, linking, masking, moving average, and quantitative display have been developed to apply to the selected data. In addition, we have explored several new brush concepts, such as non-discrete brush boundaries, simultaneous display of multiple brushes, and creating composite brushes via logical operators. Preliminary experimental evaluation with test subjects supports the usefulness of N-dimensional brushes in data exploration tasks.

JUSTIFICATION:  The paper elaborates on the concept of brushing, the ability to map features in a view of a few dimensions to other dimensional viewpoints or perspectives. The technique is in widespread use today.  From the thirteen patent citations, one may infer that it has been incorporated into commercial offerings, broadening the impact of this paper.  While he may not have invented the idea of brushing, the second author, Matt Ward, is widely credited with bringing the technique to the attention of the visualization community.

ABSTRACT: The field of visualization is getting mature. Many problems have been solved, and new directions are sought for. In order to make good choices, an understanding of the purpose and meaning of visualization is needed. Especially, it would be nice if we could assess what a good visualization is. In this paper an attempt is made to determine the value of visualization. A technological viewpoint is adopted, where the value of visualization is measured based on effectiveness and efficiency. An economic model of visualization is presented, and benefits and costs are established. Next, consequences (brand limitations of visualization are discussed (including the use of alternative methods, high initial costs, subjective/less, and the role of interaction), as well as examples of the use of the model for the judgement of existing classes of methods and understanding why they are or are not used in practice. Furthermore, two alternative views on visualization are presented and discussed: viewing visualization as an art or as a scientific discipline. Implications and future directions are identified.

JUSTIFICATION: This paper addressed the nature and impact of the field or domain of Visualization.  This paper in either of its versions has become a staple for the field, assigned as reading for students gaining their first exposure to visualization in many academic courses.  It has remained highly cited in recent years.  If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, this paper has been followed by other papers reflecting on the importance, value, .and impact of their domains, which is another justification of its impact over time.
