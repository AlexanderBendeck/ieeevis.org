As part of IEEE VIS’s [ongoing unification effort](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/blog/things-are-changing-2021), starting in 2021 some positions on both the VIS Executive Committee (VEC) and VIS Steering Committee (VSC) will be directly elected by the VIS community. These elections give the community a voice in governance, allow community members to grow into positions of authority, and will hopefully ensure a diverse representation across all of VIS. For more details about the elections process, see the [IEEE VIS Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OlfURrAEbgH0w4Gn8rbe5WpO4zusdatshf_ZqB6YVF0/).

# Register to Vote
Members of the VIS community who have participated in the conference in 3 of the last 5 years (current year included) can register to vote in this year’s election by completing the [VIS voter registration form](https://forms.gle/vbgrj81deXboumLo6). The email address you provide will be used to communicate elections instructions as the conference nears. The email address you provide will be used to communicate elections instructions as the conference nears. **Voter registration closes September 10th.**

# Participating in the Election
The 2021 Election will run from September 17th-October 17th, with results announced at the conference. The VIS Elections chairs will conduct the election using the [Belenios](https://www.belenios.org/) verifiable open-source voting system. Voting will be conducted using a ranked-choice process. 

All registered voters will receive instructions outlining the voting procedure via email before the start of the voting period. Voters will then receive two emails from Belenios containing (1) a credential (generated by Belenios), and (2) a login and password. The election will use a ranked-choice model in which voters rank candidate(s) and the [Condorcet-Schulze method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method) is used to determine winners. In the extremely unlikely event of a tie, the Elections chairs will organize a follow-up runoff election to be completed no more than four weeks later and including only the tied candidates.
