## <a name="vislies"></a>VisLies!

Tuesday, October 27<br>
13:40PM - 2:40PM Mountain Time<br>
Organizer: Kenneth Moreland and Bernice Rogowitz<br>
Contact: kmorel@sandia.gov, bernice.e.rogowitz@gmail.com

VisLies! is a yearly event at IEEE VIS. This fun and engaging evening session showcases examples of egregious perceptual, cognitive, and conceptual errors in visualization, presented by members of the Vis community.  Examples from our own work, from published papers, and from the internet highlight the many ways the visual representation can misrepresent the underlying phenomena in the data. This is a great opportunity for amusement and for learning, and every year we walk away with a smile on our faces and insights that may one day save the world.

For more information about VisLies, you can visit our website at [http://vislies.org](http://vislies.org).

## <a name="vis-newcomers"></a>VisBuddies meetup

Tuesday, October 27<br>
13:40PM - 2:40PM Mountain Time<br>
Organizer: Hsiang-Yun Wu, Karen Schloss, Jaegul Choo<br>
Contact: community@ieeevis.org

VisBuddies brings together new and returning VIS attendees with similar interests. For newcomers, this is a chance to meet experienced researchers in the field. For returning attendees, it is a chance to meet fresh talent joining VIS for the first time. You can volunteer for VisBuddies on the registration form (the latest a week prior to VIS). Based on the declared interests of attendees in the registration form, we will match pairs or small groups of attendees with different levels of VIS experience, and contact the groups via email prior to VIS.

[VisBudies organizers will provide their own meeting plattform]

## <a name="onlinepres"></a>Better Online Presentations

Tuesday, October 26<br>
14:00:00 CDT <br>
Organizer: Robert Kosara<br>
Contact: kosara@tableau.com

We've all suffered through too many Zoom meetings and online talks over the last 18 months. And we'll likely be doing this for a while longer. So how do you make your talk or lecture work when it's virtual? How do you keep people's attention? What mistakes make your talk boring or hard to listen to?
The goal of this meetup is to talk about a variety of topics around virtual talks and online classes, and learn from each other.
Topics will include:
•        Common mistakes we've all seen people make in presentations and how to avoid them. The idea is to become aware of them so you can avoid making them yourself!
•        Should you be visible all the time during your talk? What are the pros and cons?
•        Technical and setup questions, like types of microphones and cameras, how to  keep audio and video in sync, etc.
•        Making the best use of your equipment with proper microphone and camera technique, etc.
•        Getting fancy with green screen, streaming software, teleprompters, etc.
•        The difference between a live talk and recording: basic editing, sound sweetening, etc.
•        Making it interactive: features built into software like Zoom, and other tools to use for polls, small-group collaboration, etc.
•        Anything else participants want to ask about or contribute
