## <a name="vislies"></a>VisLies!

Tuesday, October 27<br>
13:40PM - 2:40PM Mountain Time<br>
Organizer: Kenneth Moreland and Bernice Rogowitz<br>
Contact: kmorel@sandia.gov, bernice.e.rogowitz@gmail.com

VisLies! is a yearly event at IEEE VIS. This fun and engaging evening session showcases examples of egregious perceptual, cognitive, and conceptual errors in visualization, presented by members of the Vis community.  Examples from our own work, from published papers, and from the internet highlight the many ways the visual representation can misrepresent the underlying phenomena in the data. This is a great opportunity for amusement and for learning, and every year we walk away with a smile on our faces and insights that may one day save the world.

For more information about VisLies, you can visit our website at [http://vislies.org](http://vislies.org).

[The Zoom link for VisLies! Meetup will be available [here](https://virtual.ieeevis.org/session_m-comm.html) soon. Login will  be required.]

## <a name="vis-newcomers"></a>VisBuddies meetup

Tuesday, October 27<br>
13:40PM - 2:40PM Mountain Time<br>
Organizer: Hsiang-Yun Wu, Karen Schloss, Jaegul Choo<br>
Contact: community@ieeevis.org

VisBuddies brings together new and returning VIS attendees with similar interests. For newcomers, this is a chance to meet experienced researchers in the field. For returning attendees, it is a chance to meet fresh talent joining VIS for the first time. You can volunteer for VisBuddies on the registration form (the latest a week prior to VIS). Based on the declared interests of attendees in the registration form, we will match pairs or small groups of attendees with different levels of VIS experience, and contact the groups via email prior to VIS.

[VisBudies organizers will provide their own meeting plattform]

## <a name="publish"></a>Publish or Publicize: How to get word out about your research beyond academia

Wednesday, October 28<br>
13:40PM - 2:40PM Mountain Time<br>
Organizer: Robert Kosara<br>
Contact: rkosara@tableau.com

Publishing your paper is all good and well, but how does the rest of the world learn about it? What ways do you have to get even academic researchers to learn about your research if they happened to miss your conference talk? There’s a healthy (if small) visualization community on Twitter, but blogging hasn’t been so hot lately, and we haven’t really established much of a foothold on YouTube. Let’s chat about what tools we have to publicize visualization research, from old-school blogging to social media, podcasts to vlogs, and beyond (anybody want to start a vis TikTok?).

[The Zoom link for Publish or Publicize Meetup will be available [here](https://virtual.ieeevis.org/session_m-publish.html) soon. Login will be required.]

## <a name="viscomm"></a>VisComm Meetup

Thursday, October 29<br>
13:40PM - 2:40PM Mountain Time<br>
Organizer: Adriana Arcia<br>
Contact: aa2594@cumc.columbia.edu

This informal gathering is an opportunity to network with others interested in using visualization for communication. Come to find a collaborator, discuss best practices, share resources, or just have some social time! Be ready to introduce yourself and say a sentence or two about what you hope to get out of meetup.

[The Zoom link for VisComm Meetup will be available [here](https://virtual.ieeevis.org/session_m-publish.html) soon. Login will be required.]

## <a name="vis-jobfair"></a>VIS Job-fair meetup

Thursday, October 29<br>
13:40PM - 2:40PM Mountain Time<br>
Organizer: Hsiang-Yun Wu, Karen Schloss, Jaegul Choo<br>
Contact: community@ieeevis.org

The goal of VIS Job-fair is to bring together job seekers and employers in one virtual venue to trade CV and employment information. Both job seekers and employers should attend with the expectation to be prepared with the link to their CV files as well as that to their job description or fliers.

[Vis Job-fair organizers will provide their own meeting plattform]


## <a name="vis-velo"></a> Le tour de VIS 2020 - MeetUp in Watopia

Thursday, October 29<br>
3:00PM Mountain Time<br>
Organizer: Jason Dykes <br>
Contact: J.Dykes@city.ac.uk

After an exciting test ride, Dan and Jason would like to invite you to join them in the wilds of Watopia for a Zwift group ride during IEEE VIS.

You'll need a trainer, Zwift, and a Zoom connection but we've set it up so that we all stay together during the ride whatever individual workout we decide to try. We recommend this light training ride - ready for longer ride at the weekend, but go with whatever you like - Zwift will keep us together!
