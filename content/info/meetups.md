## <a name="vis-lies"></a>VisLies! Meetup

Wednesday 25 October 2023<br>
12:00pm (noon)<br>
Room 103<br> 
Organizers: Kenneth Moreland and Bernice Rogowitz <br>

VisLies! is a yearly event at IEEE VIS. This fun and engaging evening session showcases examples of egregious perceptual, cognitive, and conceptual errors in visualization, presented by members of the Vis community. Examples from our own work, from published papers, and from the internet highlight the many ways the visual representation can misrepresent the underlying phenomena in the data. This is a great opportunity for amusement and for learning, and every year we walk away with a smile on our faces and insights that may one day save the world. For more information about VisLies!, you can visit our website at [http://vislies.org](http://vislies.org).


## <a name="vis-earlycareer"></a> Early Career and Friends Happy Hour Meetup

Tuesday 24 October 2023<br>

Room 103<br>
Organizers: Kristi Potter, Remco Chang, Arvind Satyanarayan, Josh Levine, and Lace Padilla<br>
Contact: <br>

Join us for a meet and mingle with those finding themselves as, or who have ever been, early career faculty, researchers, and practitioners! The meetup is a place to meet or reunite with colleagues and friends who are interested in making this a supportive community for visualization professionals who are closer to their graduation than retirement.  The goal of this meetup is to provide a safe environment to gather and discuss challenges faced in and out of the work environment.  Attendees will have the opportunity to hear about current efforts in this space, participate in peer mentoring, and build a social network that will continue to support beyond the conference.

## <a name="visxAI"></a>Meet VISxAI

Thursday 26 October 2023<br>
12:00pm (noon)<br>
Room 103<br>

orga@visxai.io <br>

VISxAI is a workshop at the intersection of visualization and artificial intelligence centered around interactive explainables. While the workshop was held online before VIS this year, this meetup gives us a platform to explore and discuss this year’s submissions together at VIS.


## <a name="JoVI"></a>Publishing Registered Reports, Interactive Articles, and Open Science at JoVI

Wednesday 25 October 2023<br>
17:00pm<br>
Room 103<br>
Organizers: Matthew Kay and Lonni Besançon <br>

mjskay@northwestern.edu <br>

The [Journal of Visualization and Interaction (JoVI)](https://www.journalovi.org) is a venue for publishing scholarly work related to the fields of visualization and human-computer interaction. JoVI is a diamond open-access venue, i.e. a purely volunteer-driven effort that charges neither author nor subscription fees. This meetup introduces JoVI, its publication processes, and the motivations for its inception. We will discuss some of the unique aspects and challenges of JoVI within the visualization field, including: publishing registered reports, publishing interactive articles (and how to archive them long term), open review processes (and challenges with blind review), and how to have transparency/reproducibility in the context of software packages.


## <a name="VisInBharat"></a>VisInBharat: Assembling Visualization Researchers Working in the Indian Context

Wednesday 25 October 2023<br>
12:00pm (noon)<br>
Room 104<br>
Organizers: Shivam Agarwal <br>

shivam.agarwal@uni-bamberg.de <br>

VisInBharat is an initiative to bring together a community of visualization researchers working in the Indian context. The initiative aims to provide a forum for discussing common challenges faced while working on projects specific to the Indian context, identifying unique opportunities for novel research (both local and global), and sharing the gained experiences. While still in the early planning stages, the goal is to assemble students, researchers, designers, and practitioners. A meetup at IEEE VIS 2023 aims to initiate a discussion on the topic to forge the path ahead. Additionally, it aims to build a team of interested individuals who are enthusiastic to help organize activities towards the VisInBharat initiative. Regardless of your experience (early PhD student or senior researcher), please join us at the meetup if the initiative resonates with you. 


## <a name="reVISit"></a>reVISit: Supporting Scalable Evaluation of Interactive Visualizations

Wednesday 25 October 2023<br>
12:00pm (noon)<br>
room 101+102 <br>
Organizers: Alexander Lex <br>
Contact: <br>
alex@sci.utah.edu <br>

The reVISit project develops open web-based infrastructure for running user study for visualization experiments. In this meetup, we would like to (a) briefly introduce the reVISit framework and how it can help you run user studies, and (b) hear from the community about their needs with regards to online user studies. Join us to discuss the future of online studies!
