## <a name="vis-lies"></a>VisLies! Meetup

Tuesday 18 October 2022<br>
12:30-14:00pm CDT<br>
Room: Oklahoma Station 1<br>

VisLies! is a yearly event at IEEE VIS. This fun and engaging evening session showcases examples of egregious perceptual, cognitive, and conceptual errors in visualization, presented by members of the Vis community. Examples from our own work, from published papers, and from the internet highlight the many ways the visual representation can misrepresent the underlying phenomena in the data. This is a great opportunity for amusement and for learning, and every year we walk away with a smile on our faces and insights that may one day save the world. For more information about VisLies!, you can visit our website at [http://vislies.org](http://vislies.org).


## <a name="vis-literacy"></a>Next Steps for Visualization Literacy Meetup

Tuesday 18 October 2022<br>
17:00-18:00pm CDT<br>
Room: Five Moons 6<br>
Organizers: Lane Harrison and Matt Kay <br>

When it comes to visualization literacy, the VIS community is reaching critical mass. Many
researchers are working on many aspects of visualization literacy, each with valuable
perspectives and contributions. <br>

In this meetup, we would like to bring together stakeholders at VIS who are interested in
visualization literacy to connect on current progress and to explore future directions. <br>

Some of our motivating questions include:<br>
* What are the different working definitions of visualization literacy? What aspects of
visualization literacy should we be measuring?
* How does visualization literacy connect to other types of literacy? (e.g. health risk
literacy, graphicacy, statistical literacy, media literacy, etc.)
* How does visualization literacy develop in learners at different stages? (e.g. kids, young
adults, college students, data scientists)
Attendees will participate in brainstorming sessions and design activities, with the goal of
reporting back to the meetup group by the end of the session. For all attendees, we will share a
group notes document memorializing the event and resulting discussion.


## <a name="vis-earlycareer"></a> Early Career and Friends Happy Hour Meetup

Tuesday 18 October 2022<br>
17:00-18:00pm CDT<br>
Room: Five Moons 7<br>
Organizers: Kristi Potter, Remco Chang, Arvind Satyanarayan, and Josh Levine<br>

Join us for a meet and mingle with those finding themselves as, or who have ever been, early career faculty, researchers, and practitioners! The meetup is a place to meet or reunite with colleagues and friends who are interested in making this a supportive community for visualization professionals who are closer to their graduation than retirement.  The goal of this meetup is to provide a safe environment to gather and discuss challenges faced in and out of the work environment.  Attendees will have the opportunity to hear about current efforts in this space, participate in peer mentoring, and build a social network that will continue to support beyond the conference.

## <a name="vis-drone"></a> Interactive Visualization for Analysis and Control of Drone Traffic Meetup 

Thursday 20 October 2022<br>
13:00-14:00pm CDT<br>
Room: Five Moons 6<br>
Organizers: Jimmy Johansson Westberg, Jonas Lundberg, and Karljohan Lundin Palmerius<br>

There is a current race in both research and industry to develop drones that trust-
fully move around, orient themselves automatically, and provide services ranging from transport and maintenance to monitoring, remote presence and surveillance. Monitoring the behavior of drones requires real-time analysis of a large amount of high-dimensional temporal data.<br>

The purpose of this meetup is to discuss current practice and future challenges in real-time, multidimensional analysis of drones with the use of interactive visualization including areas such as: <br>

* Geospatial airspace visualization
* 3D geospatial interaction
* 3D path visualization and diagrams
* Drone/robot plan/state/parameter information visualization
* Linked views between 3D geospatial visualization and diagrams
* Combined visualization of real-time data with historical and projected data


## <a name="vis-doecgf"></a> DOE CGF / US National Labs Friends and Family Meetup 

Thursday 20 October 2022<br>
12:30-13:30pm CDT<br>
Room: Five Moons 7<br>
Organizers:  Kristi Potter and Ayan Biswas<br>

The DOE Computer Graphics forum is an annual event (since the mid 1970s) that serves as a venue for US government-sponsored computer graphics and visualization scientists, engineers and practitioners to share research and development activities and build community.  This event has been virtual the last 3 years and this meetup serves as the in-person social follow-up to this yearâ€™s virtual event, held in August. We invite those connected to or wanting to connect with the national labs to attend, including staff, faculty and students, industrial partners, and future collaborators! <br>

We will start with a quick introduction of attendees and reserve the remaining time for socializing and networking. This meetup should give the early career personnel a chance to get connected with the more senior members of the group. We feel this has been lacking in the previous few years, due to the global pandemic situation. <br>
