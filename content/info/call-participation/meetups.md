Do you want to meet people who share the same interests with you, discuss a topic that you care about or that brings the visualization community forward, or share viewpoints and experiences to foster community building? If yes, organize a meetup!

### What is a meetup?

Meetups are an excellent forum to discuss a wide range of topics related to visualization. For example, if you are an experienced researcher or practitioner, consider submitting a proposal to share your knowledge in an informal setting with conference participants. Meetups welcome cross-disciplinary proposals and proposals that are devoted to particular discipline methods. For example, some recent meetups have included opportunities to discuss topics related to sonification for augmenting visualization, machine learning for big data, inclusion and diversity in visualization research, work-life balance topics, the connection between art and science, and deceptive visualizations. VIS2022  is eager to expand its meetup sessions and will consider proposals given technology resources and time availability. All meetups are public and open to everyone.

This year, meetups can be organized as online/hybrid/in-person group meetings such that they have the opportunity to reach out to a wider group of participants. You can choose whether you want to organize a formal meeting or a casual gathering, in one of those settings. 



### What do you get?

The meetup chairs will be offering an online/hybrid/in-person setup that fits your needs, finding a time slot, advertising the meetup via social media, and making sure that everything runs smoothly. For online (virtual) setup, several zoom functionalities will be at your disposal including video conferencing and messaging with up to 100 participants, [(multiple) screen sharing](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000424286-Sharing-multiple-screens-simultaneously), [collaborative whiteboard](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard), and [breakout rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476093-Enabling-breakout-rooms). The in-person (physical) meetups can be held in a room at the conference hotel or in a more informal place, depending on the type of the meetup and feasibility of arranging rooms. For the hybrid option, the idea will be to have participants joining in from a remote location via Zoom calls while the other participants are in an in-person setting. Please note that hybrid setups will be easier to arrange if the meetup organizers send in the request for such well in advance. The rolling submissions that are made closer to the Vis week, will likely have to settle for either Online or In-person. 



### What information should a meetup proposal include?

* a title,
* a responsible person (name, contact information),
* a brief description of the topic to be addressed,
* type of meetup (virtual, physical, or hybrid)
* requests for infrastructure (e.g., licence for zoom, room for physical, room + equipment in the room for hybrid)  
* a plan on how you will coordinate the meeting based on the given technology (e.g. format, accessibility),
* preferences and constraints for meetup schedule (if applicable).  For online, and hybrid  meetups slots are typically  before/after the regular paper sessions. For physical, given the different time zones are not a problem, after conference options might be possible.


### Whom to contact and where to submit the proposals?
