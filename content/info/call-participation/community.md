Our goals in Community are organizing activities at IEEE VIS conference that connect the current and next generation of visualization researchers and practitioners. We do this through providing conference activities to participants for all of the various visualization sub-communities: scientific visualization, information visualization, visual analytics, industry, etc. 

The Community activities are open to all registered IEEE VIS participants, regardless of seniority and affiliation. The activities are organized by the IEEE VIS Community Chairs, who can be reached at [community@ieeevis.org](community@ieeevis.org).

This year, there will be a few virtual meetup events:

* [VisBuddies Virtual Meetup](#visbuddies)
* [Job Flyer Online Posting](#job-flyers)
* [Job-Fair Virtual Meetup](#ajf)
