IEEE VIS 2023 Panels should address contemporary, important and/or controversial debates, issues and applications in visualization and related topics. In particular, we invite panels that:

* Bring together interest groups and discuss cross-cutting issues that are of interest to the broad VIS community
* Connect visualization with interesting application fields
* Open up interdisciplinary debates that explore the role of visualization in science and society 
* Bring visualization researchers together with potential stakeholders of visualization
* Consist of experts in fields that discuss and/or debate relevant concepts that broaden the intellectual scope of visualization research (e.g., perceptual psychology, cognitive psychology, design research, color theory, user-interface design)
* Raise controversial, important, or emerging debates in relation to visualization

Panelists should be experts in their fields who can discuss the challenges of visualization, and engage the audience and fellow panel members in a stimulating, interactive debate.

VIS Panels value diversity in perspective, opinion, and representation. The most interesting sessions are the ones where there are many different perspectives. In selecting panels, the committee will favor panels that reflect and broaden the breadth and richness of the VIS community. In curating a panel, we urge you to consider speakers that come from a variety of intellectual backgrounds, with diverse genders, ethnicities, and nationalities.


## Panel Logistics

**IEEE VIS is planned to be an in-person event. Panel proposals are therefore expected to consist of  in-person panelists, and organizers should recruit panelists who would be able to attend their panel in person.**

Panels are scheduled for the duration of an entire paper session; panel proposals should thus target 90 minutes total duration, including questions and discussion. We strongly recommend that in order to keep to time, the chair of the panel is not one of the panel speakers and instead moderates the discussion. We also recommend organizers to encourage lively discussions both within the panelists and the audience and ensure that there is sufficient time for such interactions to take place.



## Submissions

Panel proposals (5 pages max) should consist of:
1. A **description of the topic**. In case the panel follows up on the topic of a previously held panel, we ask the organizers to point this out and to detail the advances expected from the follow-up.
2. A  **description of the panel format and proposed schedule**. This should be in a separate document from the proposal itself, and should describe the order of topics to be discussed, time to be spent on panelist presentations, and mechanisms for encouraging audience participation. Based on audience feedback, the duration of panelist presentations should allow ample time for intra-panel discussion and discussions between the panel and the audience.
3. **Statements from prospective panelists**. Each panelist should include a position statement on the topic and a short biography, the total of which should be limited to *500 words* for each panelist. 

We note that submitting similar topics to multiple venues (e.g., panels and workshops) is likely to result in at most one accepted proposal so that a broad range of topics can be presented at the conference.

Submissions should be submitted via [PCS](http://new.precisionconference.com/vgtc/). Please note the [formatting guidelines](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference) when preparing your submission. 

Feel free to address any questions concerning submission, format, and content to [panels@ieeevis.org](mailto:panels@ieeevis.org).
