The IEEE VIS 2023 Poster Program offers a timely venue to present and discuss original work or highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue (please see the plagiarism statement in the end) through a forum that encourages graphical presentation, demonstration, and active engagement with IEEE VIS participants.

The presentation of posters will happen as a physical event at the conference. There will be 1-2 dedicated poster sessions in which poster authors can meet and discuss their work with conference participants. An additional web presence of posters will supplement the traditional physical installation of poster boards. More concrete details will follow soon, with the goal of creating an engaging atmosphere.

In addition to the poster presentation, the submitted two-page summary will be included in the electronic conference proceedings.

Examples of appropriate visualization work include, but are not limited to


* research exploring new problems or areas,
* results of pilot projects,
* new angles on existing (collections of) work or known datasets,
* work-in-progress presented prior to its full publication,
* any work that might particularly benefit from demonstration to and
  active discussion with the visualization community,
* the application of visualization techniques to
  specific application areas, and 
* highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue.

### INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Poster authors must submit a two-page (including references) summary of their work in the [VGTC conference two-column format](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference), using the poster format in line with the IEEE VIS Posters’ formatting guidelines.

Summaries should include a concise description of the idea, the results or findings, supporting imagery and figures, and a discussion of the implications of the work to the selected domain. Full literature searches are not expected, although relevant citations should be included.

The poster design itself does not need to be submitted with the the summary on the initial submission deadline. Instead, authors whose posters are accepted will be asked to submit their poster as a PDF at the camera-ready deadline. Authors of accepted papers will also need to bring a physical printed copy of their poster to display at the poster session at the conference. (See details below.)

### SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

All IEEE VIS poster submissions should be made through a single submission category on PCS - IEEE VIS Poster.

After logging into [PCS](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions), start your submission by selecting “VGTC > VIS 2023 > VIS Posters 2023” and then selecting a respective [IEEE VIS Area](http://ieeevis.org/year/2023/info/call-participation/area-model#description-of-vis-areas).

### Plagiarism
All submissions must be either: 1) original work that has not been presented previously at any workshop, symposium, or conference and not published previously in any archived conference proceeding, magazine, or journal or 2) a summary that highlights work presented or published by the authors in a related venue with a clear statement of attribution to the original work.

At the time of submission, it is required by the authors to state explicitly in the submission form that the submitted work is the work by the authors themselves or is a summary of the authors’ previously presented/published work with clear attribution. Plagiarism in any form is unacceptable and will lead to the removal of the submission from the review process. For more information, please see the [IEEE Plagiarism FAQ](https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/plagiarism/plagiarism.html) and the [IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual](https://pspb.ieee.org/images/files/files/opsmanual.pdf). 

### IMPORTANT DATES

* Submission Deadline: **Thursday, June 22, 2023**
* Notification of Acceptance: **Saturday, July 22, 2023**
* Final Submission of Camera Ready Summaries and Poster PDF: **Tuesday, August 15, 2023**

All deadlines are at 11:59pm (23:59) AoE **Anywhere on Earth [(AoE)](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth) (new for 2023)**.


### POSTER DESIGN AND PRINTING
A PDF copy of the display poster must be submitted on PCS by the camera-ready deadline for inclusion in the online program. 

Authors will also need to bring their own printed version of their poster to display at the conference.

VIS has no specific formatting requirements or template for display posters. However, all posters should include the same title and authors as the 2-page poster summary and should be legible from a distance of 2 meters. Posters can be no larger than size A0 (841 x 1189 mm / 33.1 x 46.8 inches) and must be in a portrait orientation. If planning to laminate your poster, make sure you leave the requisite margin on all sides. The conference will supply poster boards and Velcro for mounting and displaying all posters. 

For authors who do not wish to travel with their posters, there are several printing shops available in around Melbourne, including [Officeworks Bourke Street](https://www.officeworks.com.au/print-copy/c/pcc/posters?cm_sp=all:menu:print-copy:::posters) or [Kwik Copy William Street](https://www.kwikkopy.com.au/poster-printing), both a 10-min walk from the MCEC. Prints can be ordered online and picked up from the store.

### POSTER SESSION

There will be 1-2 dedicated poster presentation sessions throughout the week in which the posters will be presented. During these times, one or more authors have to be available physically at their poster to discuss their work. More details will follow soon.

### POSTER REVIEW PROCESS

Poster submissions are single-blind and do not need to be anonymized. Submissions will be reviewed using a juried process, during which each poster will be read and evaluated by at least two reviewers with final decisions made collectively by the Posters Chairs.  Authors will receive reviews of their submission explaining the decision and providing feedback. Authors of accepted posters are expected to address any recommendations and conditions of acceptance prior to final submission.

### BEST POSTER AWARDS 

The Best Poster awards will recognize the most outstanding poster contributions. It will be based on (1)  the significance of the research contributions described in the submitted two-page poster summaries, as well as (2) the clarity, creativity, and design of the poster. These awards will be noted in the program and presented with a signed certificate.
