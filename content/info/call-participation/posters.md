The IEEE VIS 2022 Poster Program offers a timely venue to present and discuss original work or highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue (please see the plagiarism statement in the end) through a forum that encourages graphical presentation, demonstration, and active engagement with IEEE VIS participants.

The presentation of posters is likely to take place in a physical event. There will be 1-2 dedicated poster sessions in which poster authors can meet and discuss their work with conference participants. An additional web presence of posters will supplement the traditional physical installation of poster boards. More concrete details will follow soon, with the goal of creating an engaging atmosphere consistent with past in-person poster sessions.   

In addition to the poster presentation, the submitted two-page summary will be included in the electronic conference proceedings. 

Examples of appropriate visualization work include, but are not limited to


* research exploring new problems or areas,
* results of pilot projects,
* new angles on existing (collections of) work or known datasets,
* work-in-progress presented prior to its full publication,
* any work that might particularly benefit from demonstration to and
  active discussion with the visualization community,
* the application of visualization techniques to
  specific application areas, and 
* highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue.

### INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Poster authors must submit a two-page summary of their work in the VGTC conference two-column format in line with the [IEEE VIS Posters’ formatting guidelines](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference), using the poster format.

Summaries should include a concise description of the idea, the results or findings, supporting imagery and figures, and a discussion of the implications of the work to the selected domain. Full literature searches are not expected, although relevant citations should be included.

Visit the [Posters FAQ](http://ieeevis.org/year/2022/info/call-participation/posters-faq) page for some useful tips for authors.


### SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

All IEEE VIS poster submissions should be made through a single submission category on PCS - IEEE VIS Poster.

After logging into [PCS](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions), start your submission by selecting “VGTC > VIS 2022 > VIS Posters 2022” and then selecting a respective [IEEE VIS Area](http://ieeevis.org/year/2022/info/call-participation/area-model#description-of-vis-areas).

### Plagiarism
All submissions must be either: 1) original work that has not been presented previously at any workshop, symposium, or conference, and not published previously in any archived conference proceeding, magazine, or journal; or 2) a summary that highlights work presented or published by the authors in a related venue with a clear statement of attribution to the original work. 

At the time of submission, it is required by the authors to state explicitly in the submission form that the submitted work is the work by the authors themselves, or is a summary of the authors’ previously presented/published work with clear attribution. Plagiarism in any form is unacceptable and will lead to a removal of the submission from the review process.

Authors of accepted posters are expected to address any recommendations and conditions of acceptance prior to final submission.

### BEST POSTER AWARDS 

The Best Poster awards will recognize the most outstanding poster contributions. It will be based on (1)  the significance of the research contributions described in the submitted two-page poster summaries, as well as (2) the clarity, creativity, and design of the poster. These awards will be noted in the program and presented with a signed certificate.
