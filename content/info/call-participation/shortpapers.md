IEEE VIS 2021 solicits submissions in a short paper format. Short Papers welcome submissions describing original work with focused and concise research contributions, incremental work such as follow-up extensions or evaluations of existing methods, or exploratory work. Short papers also welcome papers describing new systems or tools that offer practical value. 

Short Papers often fall into one or more of five main categories: technique or algorithm, system or tool, application or design study, empirical study, theory or model. The contributions of a short paper should be commensurate with the nature of the paper. Technique or algorithm papers should provide clear yet concise technical contributions. System or tool papers should state the value, articulate the target audience, and make an effort toward accessibility (e.g., software release). Papers focusing on visualization application or design study should demonstrate design lessons learned or insights gleaned for visualization research on which future contributors can build. Empirical study papers should justify the validity and importance of the results, including, where appropriate, the definition of hypotheses, tasks, data sets, the rigorous collection and examination/analysis/coding of data, the selection of subjects and cases, as well as validation, discussion, and conclusions. Theory or model papers should illuminate how visualization techniques complement and exploit properties of human vision and cognition, as well as how researchers conduct effective and rigorous visualization studies.

The short paper submission deadline is **~~June 13~~ June 20, 2021**, creating an opportunity to showcase late-breaking research results.

### Submission Guidelines:

Short papers can be up to four pages plus up to one page of references. Submissions will be in the VGTC conference two-column format, in line with the [IEEE VIS formatting guidelines](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/).

Short Papers allow single-blind (not anonymized) or double-blind (anonymized) submissions while reviewers’ identities are not revealed. Authors may choose whether to anonymize their submission or not. Double-blind submissions should NOT include author names or institutions on the cover page of the initial submission, and authors should make an effort to ensure that there is no revealing information in the text, such as obvious citations to authors’ previous work, or making acknowledgments to colleagues of long-standing.

**To submit a short paper, go to [the PCS system](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions) and select “VGTC > VIS 2021 > VIS 2021 Short Papers” to set up a submission.**


### Publication Details:
Accepted short papers will be presented at the VIS conference. They will also be included in the conference proceedings and published in IEEE Xplore and assigned a DOI.  

Authors of accepted short papers may subsequently submit to TVCG a full paper on the same topic, consistent with [the TVCG standard](https://www.computer.org/publications/author-resources/peer-review/journals#preliminary) requiring that papers previously published in conference proceedings make additional substantial scientific contributions that build upon the material of the conference publication or include this material as a part of a larger research effort. The authors are encouraged to make mention of this in their cover letter, provide a copy of the previous conference submission and an outline of the added contributions. Providing these materials will help TVCG reviewers to better gauge the scientific value of the work and defuse any possible misconceptions. Please note that extended versions of IEEE VIS short papers cannot be submitted as full papers to IEEE VIS any more. Accepted TVCG submissions that build upon previously published IEEE VIS short papers cannot be presented at IEEE VIS again. 
 
Concurrent submissions of short papers and posters are not possible (i.e., one cannot submit the same work both as a Short Paper and as a Poster).

### Important Dates (postponed):

* Submission Deadline: **~~June 13~~ June 20, 2021** (no separate abstract deadline)
* Notification: **~~July 18~~  July 25, 2021**
* Submission of Camera-Ready Final Version: **~~August 1~~ August 8, 2021**

All deadlines are at **5:00pm Pacific Time (PDT)**.
