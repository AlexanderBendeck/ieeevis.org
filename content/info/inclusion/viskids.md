The IEEE VIS conference is excited to support our VISKids and young families!  

St. Pete Beach is a child-friendly city and Trade Winds Island Grand Resort is a great place to visit with kids! With these initiatives, we hope to facilitate the attendance of those with young families.

We are currently collecting additional information to plan the VISKids so we can support your needs better. We have limited funding, so it would be crucial to identify what are the main needs parents traveling with their children would require for the conference. 

We started exploring Nanny services, but the quotes are quite high, and the service wasn't used much in the past, therefore we would like to gather interest and needs first to decide how to use our funds. For this we kindly ask you to complete the [VISKids interest form](https://forms.gle/16VAjbkDXa7oFnyw6 )

The conference hotel offers a [day camp program](https://www.tradewindsresort.com/explore/resort-recreation) Tu-Su, 10am-1pm and 2-5pm for children 5-12 at the cost of $20 per child. VISKids can assist parents in making other childcare arrangements. Please express your interests and needs by e-mailing VISKids 

### VISKids Hello
Prior to the conference, we will give you the opportunity to connect with other VISKids parents to meet and greet and share plans for adventures in Melbourne. 

### VISKids Community
We share further information with the VISKids Community on other potential funding sources in an [online document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S5nkD4exOvY2hDn747RXfVjJCype4Co5iKYAutsT2WY/edit?usp=sharing). We invite you to participate and share your ideas and tips.
