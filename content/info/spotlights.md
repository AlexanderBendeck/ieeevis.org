### Summary

Technological advances in biological experimental approaches for studying human tissues at
single-cell resolution are producing large amounts of complex data and are offering new ways to
ask questions with far-reaching impacts on human health. To allow for comprehensive analysis
and comparison of the generated data, the ultimate goal is to construct an atlas of the human
body that characterizes the cell types, tissue structures, and abundance of different types of
biomolecules across these structures. The data supporting these atlas efforts, however, is
creating challenging visualization problems due to 1) the dimensionality and density of the data
and 2) the multi-modal measurements (including proteins, genes, and metabolites) associated
with these structures in both 2D images and 3D volumes. Additionally, many datasets routinely
include tens of thousands to millions of cells, with up to thousands of measurements per cell,
resulting in critical scalability challenges.

This new paradigm of tissue atlas construction presents many relevant visualization challenges
that will require the visualization community’s expertise to address. Due to the inherent
anatomical nature of the data, biologists need to interact with this data in spatial and hierarchical
contexts using visualization systems that are able to handle multi-modal visualization and
queries at scale. Particularly in the context of diseases, visualizations are required to allow for
comparisons of normal vs. disease, context of other biomedical information, display of
uncertainty, and tools for education and training. Some of these visualization efforts have
already been applied to cancer and kidney disease and are having impacts on research in
human health.

We aim to identify future avenues of visualization research that can be helpful for exploring and
analyzing data within these cell atlases. Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR) offer
potential for navigation and data analysis in 3D, but require careful consideration of useful
techniques for users. Additionally, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches are being employed and
will require explainable/interpretable visualization techniques. We plan to focus part of the panel
discussion on the advantages and opportunities of employing these visualization technologies
to aid in our understanding of human biology and aim to identify worthwhile future directions for
visualization research to target.

### Speakers
**Ajay Pillai** - Dr. Ajay Pillai joined the National Human Genome Research Institute’s Extramural
Research Program as program director in 2006. He manages a portfolio of grants focused on
data and knowledge resources, single cell biology, AI/ML methods development including
approaches to development of ethical AI, and other computational approaches. He co-leads two
Common Fund programs: HuBMAP (single-cell mapping of “normal” human tissue and organs)
and IDG (developing computational and experimental reagents to study under-studied proteins).
He co-leads a trans-NIH effort on developing and sustaining data and knowledge resources. He
also co-leads a new NHGRI program, MorPhiC (Molecular Phenotypes of Null Alleles in Cells),
that aims in the long-term to develop a consistent catalog molecular and cellular phenotypes for
null alleles for every human gene by using in-vitro multicellular systems.

**Mark Keller** - Mark Keller is a PhD student in the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics
Program at Harvard Medical School. Previously, he was a software developer with a B.S. in
Computer Science from the University of Maryland and a former intern in the Summer Institute
in Biomedical Informatics in the Gehlenborg Lab. Mark is the lead software developer on
Vitessce: Visual integration tool for exploration of spatial single cell experiments.

**Barbora Kozlíková** - Dr. Barbora Kozlíková is an Associate Professor at the Faculty of
Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. She is a member of the Department of
Visual Computing and is also heading the Visitlab research group focusing on diverse topics in
visualization. Bara got her Ph.D. in Computer Graphics in 2011 and her main research interests
are visualization and visual analysis with diverse application areas, including biochemistry,
medicine, geography, and criminology. With her 7 Ph.D. students she is working on many
interesting research topics. She is also responsible for several courses taught at her faculty and
is always interested in starting new collaborations. With her colleagues and friends, she is also
organizing events for the community, e.g. the EG EuroVis 2018 conference and also the EG
VCBM 2019 workshop. https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xkozlik/

**Stefan Bruckner** - Dr. Stefan Bruckner is a visualization researcher and professor at the
University of Rostock, where he is the head the Chair of Visual Analytics at the Institute for
Visual and Analytic Computing since February 2023. Previously, he was professor of
visualization at the Department of Informatics of the University of Bergen in Norway. He
investigates methods for gaining insight into complex data to further scientific understanding
and discovery, medical diagnosis and treatment, and engineering, as well as techniques for
communicating these findings to the public. Building on these foundations, his current interests
include the development of novel interactive approaches for the inquiry of large-scale
heterogeneous data spaces in data-driven science. Stefan was program co-chair of EuroVis,
PacificVis, the Eurographics Workshop on Visual Computing for Biology and Medicine, the
Eurographics Medical Prize, and is an associate editor of the journals IEEE Transactions on
Visualization and Computer Graphics and Computers & Graphics. He currently serves on the
Eurographics Executive Committee and is member of ACM SIGGRAPH, Eurographics, and the
IEEE Computer Society.

**Morgan Turner** - Dr. Morgan Turner is an R&D Manager and Visualization Scientist in the
Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. She was previously a
postdoctoral research associate and CRA/CCC/NSF Computing Innovation Fellow in the
Interactive Visualization Lab at the University of Minnesota, focusing on developing visualization

received her PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Brown University in 2021. During her
PhD, she developed methods of visualizing 3D kinematic data generated from high-speed X-ray
videography, as well as collaborated on the development of Virtual Reality visualizations for
analyzing volumetric flow patterns of mud during dinosaur footprint formation.
