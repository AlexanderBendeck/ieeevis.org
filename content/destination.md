Only 25 minutes from Melbourne’s international airport, your short trip into the city centre is quick and easy with options ranging from dedicated Skybus (running express between the Melbourne Airport and Melbourne’s city centre, 24 hours a day, seven days a week) to individual passenger services. The airport accommodates a vast airline network with many direct flights and 24/7 operations and services, offering maximum flexibility for delegates.

If you are flying into Avalon airport the commute to MCEC will take between 40 - 50 minutes. You can catch a taxi from outside your terminal or request an Uber.

Once in the city, you’ll come to appreciate Melbourne’s grid layout which makes it one of the most convenient cities in the world to navigate. The extensive public transport network offers trams, trains, buses and taxis providing ample options for those wishing to explore the city landmarks, culture, food and wine and events.

Tram routes 96, 109 and 12 (Stop 124A Casino/MCEC) will all take you to the Clarendon Street entrance. Otherwise, tram routes 70, 75 and the City Circle (Stop D5) take you to Flinders Street. From there, it’s just a short walk up Clarendon Street until you reach the MCEC. Travel on trams is free in Melbourne's Central Business District and Docklands. All stops within the free zone are clearly marked and tram drivers will make regular announcements when approaching the zone boundaries. 


#### Onsite Car Parking

## DISCOVER THE REGION


While in Australia, why not take some time to explore the region around Melbourne (Victoria)?
Travel across Victoria and experience the region's stunning landscapes, historic towns and renowned food and wine. The state's compact size means you can travel from high in the mountains to the rugged southern coast and back to the city in just a short space of time. So hit the road on a touring route, make your own way around, or follow an itinerary and see the wonders of Victoria for yourself.

### Great Ocean Road Touring Route

One of Victoria's most scenic drives, the Great Ocean Road is a magnificent three-day self-drive touring route from surf capital Torquay to the iconic 12 Apostles, ending at historic fishing village Port Fairy. Along the way, spot koalas, kangaroos and even whales, zip-line your way through a treetop canopy, climb to the peak of a volcanic crater, and relax over regional dining atop a cliff or by the beach.
