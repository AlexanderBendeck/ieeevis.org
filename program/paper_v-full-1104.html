Here we introduce InnovationInsights, an interactive visual analysis system for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to explore the complex linkages between science and technology, and to identify critical innovations, inventors, and potential partners.

We evaluate the system through two case studies with experts followed by expert interviews. We further engage a premier research institution to test-run the system, helping its institution leaders to extract new insights for innovation. Through both the case studies and the engagement project, we find that our system not only meets our original goals of design, allowing users to better identify the sources of technical inventions and to understand the broad impact of scientific research; it also goes beyond these purposes to enable an array of new applications for researchers and research institutions, ranging from identifying untapped innovation potential within an institution to forging new collaboration opportunities between science and industry."><meta name="twitter:image" content="https://ieeevis.b-cdn.net/vis_2023/paper_images/v-full-1104.png"><meta name="image" property="og:image" content="https://ieeevis.b-cdn.net/vis_2023/paper_images/v-full-1104.png"><meta name="description" property="og:description" content="Science has long been viewed as a key driver of economic growth and rising standards of living.

Not only has science long been recognized as the engine for long-run economic growth and prosperity, but also it has been essential to creating critical solutions to confront emergent threats to humanity, from climate change to the COVID-19 pandemic. While scientific research propels both fundamental understanding and practical applications, there has been a lack of visual analytics approaches to explore the complex linkages (i.e., the dual frontiers) between scientific advances and technical inventions.
