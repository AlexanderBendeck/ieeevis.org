Hello VIS Community,

In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty around Australian travel restrictions, the VEC and the 2022 core conference committee have decided that it is in the best interest of the conference and the community to postpone the Melbourne, Australia event until 2023. The VEC truly appreciates the flexibility and dedication shown by our co-chairs Tim Dwyer, Sarah Goodwin and Michael Wybrow, and we are certain that VIS 2023 in Melbourne, Australia will be worth the wait! 

The VEC is pleased to announce that VIS 2022 will be held in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA. David Ebert, Danielle Szafir, and Hendrik Strobelt will co-chair the conference, and planning is already underway for the venue. We are grateful to David, Danielle and Hendrik for their upcoming leadership. We hope to see everyone in OKC next year!
