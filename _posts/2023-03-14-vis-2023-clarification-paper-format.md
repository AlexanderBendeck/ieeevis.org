The paper submission format this year includes the possibility of adding content other than references on the 10th and 11th pages of a submission.
As stated in the submission guidelines, this additional non-reference material can include “Supplemental Material, Figure Credits, and Acknowledgements sections”. 

Please note, however, that this new additional material only includes pointers to the actual Supplemental Material (which is submitted elsewhere) and explanations of what was included, as well as credits for the figures that appear in the first nine pages of the submission (only necessary if using material that requires crediting because it was previously published elsewhere; nothing needed for new figures generated by the authors). 

Do NOT include actual supplemental materials or actual paper figures and captions on the 10th and 11th pages.
