Hello VIS Community!

We’re introducing a blog for IEEE VIS, and we’ll kick off the blog with a series of posts by the reVISe committee to highlight some of the things that will be different at IEEE VIS 2021 and beyond. 

Regular attendees of IEEE VIS will be aware that big changes are coming to IEEE VIS in 2021: VIS 2020 will be the last time we will have three separate conferences (VAST, InfoVis, and SciVis) that make up the conference. Instead, going forward the content of these three conferences will be under one single conference: IEEE VIS. 

In this blog post we will briefly introduce the main changes coming, after giving a bit of historical context and rationale and will point to future posts in this series. 

## History
IEEE VIS has undergone many changes over its history. Founded in 1990 as the “IEEE Conference on Visualization”, it originally mostly disseminated work that would have fit best into today’s SciVis conference. In 1995, the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis) was held for the first time (the oldest surviving website is from [1996](https://www.hpc.msstate.edu/conferences/vis96/)), and finally the IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics, Science and Technology (VAST) joined the conference. InfoVis and VAST graduated to “conferences” from the “smaller” symposium event type in 2007 and 2011 respectively (using IEEE’s terminology). In the mid-2000s, VIS also began a now well-established collaboration with the top journal for visualization research, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG), that now publishes most papers of these three conferences. All of this is well illustrated in this figure by [Isenberg et al.](https://sites.google.com/site/vispubdata/home):

In that time, VIS has grown to a large conference with about 1200 attendees, multiple satellite events and workshops, and an impressive volume of high quality publications. 

Yet, the three-conference structure was beginning to show its age, and many organizational and scientific issues arose that can be traced back to this separation. 

## Restructuring 
In 2016, the VIS Executive Committee (VEC) [formed a committee to explore alternative conference structures](http://ieeevis.org/governance/restructuring) that may enhance vibrancy and growth. To make this as democratic as possible, the committee elicited feedback from the community and held multiple workshops. 

Based on that committee’s recommendation, in 2019 the reVISe committee was formed to make concrete proposals for re-organizing the conference under a single umbrella. This committee then prepared a proposal for unification that was presented to the community at VIS 2019 and formally adopted by the relevant bodies (VEC, the VAST, InfoVis, and SciVis steering committees, and VGTC), with minor amendments. After a transition period in 2020, VIS 2021 will be fully integrated. 

## What will Change?

The changes will affect authors, committee members, and organizers of the conference. Some changes, especially to the governance of VIS have already been made. For example, the three steering committees for VAST, InfoVis, and SciVis have been dissolved and are replaced with one unified steering committee for the whole conference. 

Other changes are yet to come, the most significant is the dissolution of the three conferences to which authors usually submit to. Instead, VIS will have a unified program committee and an [area model](http://ieeevis.org/governance/area-model) for publications. Unlike the previous conferences, areas are lightweight administrative divisions designed to evolve over time. 

Some of the advantages of these changes are: 

A consistent experience for authors and reviewers, with a single call for papers and consistent rules for all publications (TVCG vs. conference papers, paper types, short papers, posters, to name just a few examples) will make the process easier, especially for first-time authors and reviewers of the conference. 
A better home for work that doesn’t fit neatly into only one of the three conferences: previous authors will likely have experienced the problem of selecting the “best” conference for their paper. 
The flexibility of the area model will allow research topics to emerge, grow, and shrink over time without implications to the organizational structure of the conference. 
The conference has usually staffed each organizing role in triplicates, with one representative from the three conferences each. Going forward, roles will be filled based on qualification and the need for a certain number of committee members, instead of having exactly three chairs with loose affiliation with a different conference for each one. 

Ultimately, we hope that these changes will aid in unifying, strengthening, and growing our IEEE VIS community. 

## What’s Next?

We will follow up this introductory post with blog posts about: 
The area model
The new keywords 
The new governance structure of VIS. 

The reVISe committee, will also, as in 2019, hold another town-hall meeting at VIS to answer questions by the community about the upcoming changes. You are also welcome to leave comments or ask questions by e-mailing revise@ieeevis.org. 

The reVISe committee, 

Christoph Garth (chair), Min Chen, Alex Endert, Petra Isenberg, Alexander Lex, Shixia Liu, Anders Ynnerman.
